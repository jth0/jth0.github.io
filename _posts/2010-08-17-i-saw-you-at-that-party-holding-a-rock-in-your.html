title: I saw you at that party, holding a rock in your fingers. I popped a mint. I
  cleared my throat. I had pennies in my loafers. I ate red meat. I could change.
  I told you, I would change. I knew by your face, you weren’t so sure. I was drunk.
  I wasn’t your type. I kissed you on the Lakefill. I lifted a lash off your face.
  I didn’t tell you, my parents belonged to a country club. I had season tickets.
  I thought, you looked so clean, you smelled like stems.I walked behind you. You
  led the rallies. I lost my mother. You rubbed my back.
