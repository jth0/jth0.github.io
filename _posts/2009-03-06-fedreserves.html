I&rsquo;m not sure though; the spikes back around the October timeframe could have been related to an influx of cash at the Fed, the bailout, or changing environments. The thing that&rsquo;s hard to differentiate from a simple graph like this is what it actually means. The lines off the left side are basically immobile for the past 50-100 years, or as long as each piece of data was collected. It&rsquo;s very easy to take that fact and say the spikes we see today is horrible. But it&rsquo;s not that easy. Interest rates have also been near zero for several months now, and this may simply represent bank activities where they&rsquo;re borrowing from reserves. Because it&rsquo;s cheap money, they can leverage it and re-lend for a few months, returning their loans before the interest rates go up and eat into profits.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think I know enough about finance and banking to have a better answer, but it is very slightly comforting to see the lines moving in the correct direction to return to pre-2008 numbers.</p>
