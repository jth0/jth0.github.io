<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What</strong> <a href="https://www.familytreeclinic.org/arborfest/">Arborfest</a> is an evening featuring the best locally hand-crafted beers to sample, music, tasty eats, a brewery swag raffle &amp; competition, non-alcoholic drinks, and a darn good time!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget hanging out with all the brewers and brewery staff/beer slingers.</p>

<blockquote>
