  If you’re concerned that you may have published a statement on your blog that could be false or cause harm to someone’s reputation (or someone is claiming you have), check out The Bloggers’ FAQ on Online Defamation Law.

  The Bloggers’ FAQ on Intellectual Property will help you understand your rights to link to information, quote from articles and blogs, or otherwise use someone else’s creative works. It also addresses situations where you can use the brand name of a good or service in your blog. Here you can also learn about the right of publicity, which is relevant if you want to use someone’s name or image in a commercial context.

  Trade secret law concerns the protection of confidential corporate information; for more information see the Chilling Effects Clearinghouse’s FAQ on trade secret law.

  The Bloggers’ FAQ on Privacy covers “publication of private facts” law, which is designed to protect a person’s private information, even if the information is truthful. It also addresses “intrusion into seclusion” law, which is designed to protect people’s privacy and their interest in being left alone.

I have yet to receive any complaints about posted content on this site, but I thought sharing my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_operandi">modus operandi</a> for this blog wouldn&rsquo;t hurt&hellip;</p>

<p>When I post content on this blog, I include an excerpt only, as well as any commentary or explanation as to why I think that content was interesting or relevant. Whenever I can, I credit both the creator of content posted, as well as the source where I was initially pointed to the posted content. I will sometimes include a &ldquo;via chain&rdquo;, but those get monotonous and aren&rsquo;t really very helpful, so I don&rsquo;t do that consistently. In any case, if you are the copyright holder of content I posted on this blog and object to its inclusion, please <a href="https://twitter.com/jth">contact</a> <a href="mailto:john.t.hoffoss@gmail.com">me</a> or post a comment on the post you&rsquo;re objecting to, and make sure you leave me a way to contact you in return.</p>

<p>Please be aware that I&rsquo;m much easier to work with if you&rsquo;re asking politely before calling your lawyer, and in many cases, I am both referring directly to the content on your site, as well as providing a link to the full content on your site.</p>
