  Paris held its own elections recently. My favorite candidate proposed building a ski lift on Montmartre and opening the hill to alpine sports. His program also included keeping the cemeteries open all night (to reestablish a conversation between the living and the dead), and introducing commuting by hot-air balloon.

  The French love Obama like you wouldn’t believe.
