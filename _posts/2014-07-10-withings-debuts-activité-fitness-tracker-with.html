<blockquote><p>Now we’re talking. First “smart” watch design I like. Hint: a classic, minimal, round face. Useless for me - I wouldn’t use a pedometer and I don’t sleep enough to analyze the coma I fall into every night - but nice nevertheless.</p>

<p>That is a product category that may become interesting, after all.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been wearing a fitbit for a few months now, and I really like the awareness that these trackers bring to how you move, sleep, etc. It&rsquo;s about time someone makes one that isn&rsquo;t identifiable across a room. More than that, since none of these do much more than track steps/movement, this design has been minimized to a sane level where I don&rsquo;t need to plug it in every week. (I would be willing to do so if it covered other things like heart-rate or somesuch, but very few of the bands on the market do, and those ones are big and ugly.)</p>
