<p>Meredith Dittmar&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.corporatepig.com/">art</a> has a youthful, fantastic feel to it. Her works present a beautiful world full of an organic mix of natural and industrial themes. Trees melt into cities, flowers into inner-gears, leaving you to decide whether each component in a work is beast or machine, or where the transitions sit. Several of her works also have some Native American imagery in a natural and pleasing way. (This is notable for me, because those themes don&rsquo;t generally resonate with me.) Her piece &ldquo;Schooled in the Mystery&rdquo; is particularly delightful to dive into and explore.</p>
