<blockquote><p><b>Ed. Note: </b>In the continuing spirit of trying out new stuff, we’re going to start up a new-ish approach to ads and content called Content Partnerships.  Instead of just posting ads that interrupt the normal flow, I’ve approached some folks who are doing cool things in the Twin Cities, and I’m helping them create web content for this here blog that might be something you’d like to check out.  In return, they’re hooking me up with something.</p>
