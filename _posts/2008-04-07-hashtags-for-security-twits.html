<p>Over the course of two months, Jennifer Legio (<a href="https://twitter.com/mediaphyter">mediaphyter</a>) has amassed a list of around 80 Information Security twitterers <a href="https://mediaphyter.wordpress.com/2008/02/01/security-twits/">here</a> on her <a href="https://mediaphyter.wordpress.com/">blog</a>. This list will grow during and after RSA, I&rsquo;m betting.</p>

<p>While this group of folk is more interesting than your average industrial grouping of folk, there&rsquo;s a lot of chatter that can make it tough for new followers to see the value in the <i>security twit</i> crowd. It can also be hard for those that see the value find the security-related content. So I propose using <a href="https://www.stoweboyd.com/message/2007/08/hash-tags-twitt.html">#hashtags</a> to label the gems, jewels, great, or otherwise relevant security tweets that we all post from time to time. This process is nice and simple, which should make it easier to gain traction in this practice. Also useful for those at <a href="https://hashtags.org/tag/rsaconference/">#rsaconference</a> and those <a href="https://hashtags.org/tag/notatrsa/">#notatrsa</a>.</p>

<ol><li>[If you&rsquo;re not on twitter already] sign up to <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a>.</li>
<li>Let <a href="https://twitter.com/mediaphyter">@mediaphyter</a> know you&rsquo;re in security and would like to be listed as a security twit.</li>
<li>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtags">@hashtags</a>, which will cause your hashed tweets to be indexed by <a href="https://hashtags.org">#hashtags</a>.</li>
<li>Use the hash <a href="https://hashtags.org/tag/sectwits/">#sectwits</a>.
</li><li>Profit!. Or at least, just keep tweeting your security insights, questions and news!</li></ol>
<p>
Update: Evidently, Hashtags misses posts intermittently. <a href="https://tweetscan.com">Tweetscan</a> is a good alternative to search hashtags (and tweets in general) and does not require following anyone as a precursor to indexing. </p>
