<p>Well, <a href="https://www.sans.org/newsletters/newsbites/newsbites.php?vol=10&amp;issue=5&amp;rss=Y">this</a> was a matter of time. The evil hackers broke into power companies&rsquo; terribly-secured IT systems and then demanded payment or face system shutdown. Well, someone called the bluff and got systems shut down. This is the first active attack I have heard of thus far, but the CIA had deliberated for awhile whether to release this or not, (according to the linked site) I just hope this is not the first that the power companies across the country have heard.</p>
