<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.btmcelrath.com/mall/more.asp?ProdID=143">B.T. McElrath - Salty Dog Chocolate Bar</a></p>
<p>THIS. IS. MY. NEW. FAVORITE. THING.</p>
<p>(hint: my birthday is in February and consumable presents are the best onesâ€¦)</p></blockquote>

<p>Brian (B.T.) used to live behind me. He used to throw chocolate tasting parties while he was growing and developing his business and product line. He stopped throwing those by the time I bought my house. That makes me sad.</p>

<p>But it was good for Brian and Christine, since their business was going nuts. They still make all their stuff by hand, though. It&rsquo;s a small world&hellip;</p>
