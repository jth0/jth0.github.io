<em>11:42</em> St the Living Green Expo with all the hippies and looking for lunch. Good times! <a href="https://twitter.com/jth/statuses/802683131">#</a>

<em>21:18</em> Bought a Belgian dubbel kit to brew tomorrow. Next one will be a wit or Belgian blonde, nice summer beers. <a href="https://twitter.com/jth/statuses/802946182">#</a>

<em>21:28</em> I think I might have let my ESB settle too much when I bottled. Not ready after three weeks, and no yeast in the bottle at all. <a href="https://twitter.com/jth/statuses/802950681">#</a>

<em>21:40</em> Unless that beer just hasn&rsquo;t settled out yet. I hope I don&rsquo;t end up having to dump it out&hellip; <a href="https://twitter.com/jth/statuses/802955843">#</a>
