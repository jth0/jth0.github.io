<p>We are selling a slightly used Douglas Fir tree to a new loving and caring home. The fir itself has been well taken care of, watered on a regular basis, and kept free of any harmful insect or pest.

</p><p>The tree itself stands about 6 feet tall and has a diameter of approximately 4-5 feet at the base. The base has been trimmed for a clean look about 8 inches up from the base itself. The tree has suffered no damages, and has been kept relatively clean, all ornamental additions have been placed on the tree with temporary fastening systems and can be removed prior to sale.

</p><p>We decided to get rid of the tree when we realized that it just didn&rsquo;t work with the furniture in the room and seemed to cramp the space. We tried for about three weeks, and we would love to keep it, but it just doesn&rsquo;t work for us.

</p><p>The tree is currently in an upright position and should be stored as such. Water is required on an every other day basis, and no pruning is necessary.

</p><p>We do not have the facilities to deliver, but will be more than happy to help you load the specimen into your truck or van. No cars please, unless you are willing to take all responsibility for damages of tying the tree onto your hood or roof.

</p><p>If you are interested or have questions, please feel free to email us! </p></blockquote>
