  <p>I hope that nobody’s feelings got too stirred up by the model pictures ordeal. I will now attempt to relieve any pain that was caused by doing something called <em>over-sharing</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you nuts? I saw no over-sharing. Just some under-dressed ladies.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have always been overweight. I was tortured by others for it in middle school, I tortured myself for it in high school, and we all know what’s happened on account of it in college. Few things get me more passionate, over-excited and stupid than issues of body image. But saying that I’ve been struggling with weight my entire (admittedly, thus far, short) life is only half of the truth. The more important battle here is simply self-esteem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never, ever met a woman who didn&rsquo;t have huge issues with this. Ever.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Y’all are gorgeous. And you know what? Even with my cystic breakout, my perpetually three months pregnant belly, my ashy roots, my colossal arms and my nonexistent waist, so am I. So the fuck am I.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fuckin&rsquo; A you are. What, what!? You&rsquo;re gonna be a baby-momma? That&rsquo;s gonna be one lucky little kid!</p>
