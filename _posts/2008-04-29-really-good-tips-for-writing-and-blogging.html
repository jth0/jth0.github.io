With exception to the &ldquo;use lists&rdquo; item, these tips are fantastic. I avoid blogs that incessantly post lists. If I wanted to be cheesy, I&rsquo;d create a top-ten list of reasons to avoid lists. And this item I&rsquo;m re-blogging is a list. But still, if you use lists, use them sparingly. Your average reader only has so much patience for random, non-cohesive ideas.

<p>If anything, use a list but don&rsquo;t post it. Instead, post n-2 of those items listed as individual blog posts that are thoughtfully written and share your own insights. I say n-2 because inevitably, two items on that list won&rsquo;t be worth a full post on their own, or can be integrated into the items you&rsquo;ve thought of.

<blockquote><p>You can improve your writing (your business writing, your ad writing, your thank you notes and your essays) if you <a href="https://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/04/write-like-a-bl.html">start thinking like a blogger</a>:  </p>

<li>
<i>Use headlines.</i> I use them all the time now. Not just boring ones that announce your purpose (like the one on this post) but interesting or puzzling or engaging headlines. Headlines are perfect for engaging busy readers.</li>
<li>
<i>Realize that people have choices.</i> With 80 million other blogs to choose from, I know you could leave at any moment (see, there goes someone now). So that makes blog writing shorter and faster and more exciting. </li>
<li>
<i>Drip, drip, drip. </i>Bloggers don’t have to say everything at once. We can add a new idea every day, piling on a thesis over time.</li>
<li>
<i>It’s okay if you leave.</i> Bloggers aren’t afraid to include <a href="https://www.greylodge.org/gpc/?p=1357">links</a> or distractions in their writing, because we know you’ll come back if what we had to say was interesting.</li>
<li>
<i>Interactivity is a great shortcut. </i>Your readers care about someone’s opinion even more than yours… their own. So reading your email or your comments or your trackbacks (your choice) makes it easy to stay relevant. </li>
<li>
<i>Gimmicks aren’t as useful as insight.</i> If you’re going to blog successfully for months or years, sooner or later you need to actually say something. Same goes for your writing.</li>
<li>
<i>Don’t be afraid of lists. </i>People like lists.</li>
<li>
<i>Show up.</i> Not writing is not a useful way of expressing your ideas. Waiting for perfect is a lousy strategy.</li>
<li>
<i>Say it.</i> Don’t hide, don’t embellish.</li>
