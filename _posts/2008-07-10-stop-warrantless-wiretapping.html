<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/07/continue">Stop warrantless wiretapping.</a><br/><p>If you agree that the FISA amendments passed yesterday by the United States Congress violates the fourth amendment of our constitution, please consider donating to the Electronic Frontier Foundation. I choose to support their legal battles to protect my fourth amendment rights. They are also working to seek punitive damages against the major telecommunications companies that provided the private data of United States citizens to the government unlawfully and without warrant.</p>
