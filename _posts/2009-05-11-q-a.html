  <p>Is there really no way to have multiple photos in a single Tumblr post using the “add photo” button? Or am I just slow? And is this topic itself worth an entire post?</p>

<p>No, you can&rsquo;t. You might be able to publish a few photos as &ldquo;private&rdquo;, then grab those URLs and use the &lt;img&gt; tag, but I&rsquo;m not sure. Otherwise, you&rsquo;d have to use the &lt;img&gt; tag with URLs from Flickr or somewhere else.</p>
