Gone are those halcyon days of <a href="https://ebayimages.goantiques.com/dbimages/WYV8212/WYV8212026.jpg">a studly stag, looking out over a serene pond, eloquently applied to a piece of fine velvet</a>. Perhaps we will be lucky enough to have lost the days of similar images ironed onto too-large <a href="https://www.mileskimball.com/MilesKimball/Shopping/ProductDetail.aspx?CID=&amp;SCID=&amp;ProductID=313056&amp;SiteNum=0">sweatshirts</a> and <a href="https://www.agifttotreasure.com/index.php?cPath=93_39_175&amp;osCsid=b4ac2ca0be577196073c711af0934413">pillows</a>.</p>

If it only took just one book to free us from that imagery&hellip;</p>
