The police identified it, reported it to the FBI, then promptly had their memory wiped or something&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Sheriff&rsquo;s Office notified the FBI. Sheriff&rsquo;s Detective David Thatcher obtained a search warrant June 23. Sheriff&rsquo;s spokeswoman Debbie Carter said that she was unaware of the theft and that Thatcher no longer had the case. It was assigned to a second detective who also was transferred, and she did not know which detective was now handling it. The Sheriff&rsquo;s Office records division was unable to find a report of the break-in on Monday. A clerk did locate a record of when the call was received and which officers responded.</p>

  <p>A spokesman for the Miami-Dade Police Department said Monday he could find no record of property seized at the warehouse within the past four months. Hillsborough sheriff&rsquo;s records show iGov&rsquo;s facility manager, Mike Kalinowski, reported the missing computers to the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office after he arrived at work March 8. However, when a Times reporter asked him about the case, Kalinowski responded: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know anything about that.&rdquo;</p>
