  <p>Besides being April Fool’s Day, April 1st is also Flat Earth’s 2nd Anniversary party! Starting at 4:00 pm the Muddy Pig will be serving up Flat Earth favorites, along with their newest brew, Northwest Passage IPA. Made with the finest Canadian malts and loaded up with Chinook, Cascade, Simcoe and Columbus hops! {<a href="https://mnbeer.com/2009/03/17/flat-earth-2nd-anniversary/">mnbeer</a>}</p>

<p>This was fun, as getting together with local brewers over a pint is wont to be. Also, I know the guy who hooked the Muddy Pig up with a beer engine, along with a number of other pubs in the cities. In fact, most of the places now advertising &ldquo;cask&rdquo; ales (which are awesome.) If your local pub is in dire need of fresh, delicious cask ale served from a beer engine, just let me know and I&rsquo;ll put my friend on the prowl!</p>
