title: Well, wake up to the national security threat. Only it’s not coming from abroad,
  but from our own domestic extremists. We tend to think of national security narrowly
  as the risk of a military or terrorist attack. But national security is about protecting
  our people and our national strength — and the blunt truth is that the biggest threat
  to America’s national security this summer doesn’t come from China, Iran or any
  other foreign power. It comes from budget machinations, and budget maniacs, at home.
