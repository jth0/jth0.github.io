<p>This was my second batch of homebrew. <em>After losing this information for one of my batches, I&rsquo;m posting my notes on each batch of beer I&rsquo;ve brewed to share, and to document my progress and alterations to each recipe.</em></p>

<h1><a href="https://northernbrewer.com/alekits.html">Extra Special Bitter</a> kit #1021 from Northern Brewer. {<a href="https://www.northernbrewer.com/promash/1021_.html">ProMash Recipe</a>}</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our ESB is quite possibly the ultimate hop experience. Goldings hops make sure you&rsquo;ll know this beer from across a room while wearing a blindfold. All this is balanced with a judicious amount of gold malt syrup and a sweet, fruity yeast strain.</p>

<h2>Stats</h2>

<ul>
<li>Brewed: 29 March 2008.</li>
<li>O.G.: 1.047, right where the kit said it should be.</li>
<li>Racked: 14 April 2008 @ 1.015</li>
<li>Bottled: 20 April 2008.</li>
<li>F.G.: 1.014, around 4.5% ABV.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>Drank most of this way too soon, too. This came out quite nice, especially since I let it condition in the bottle properly. Racking to secondary was mostly so I could start another batch in the primary. Still came out nice and balanced, a good session beer that I&rsquo;ll probably take on again.</p>
