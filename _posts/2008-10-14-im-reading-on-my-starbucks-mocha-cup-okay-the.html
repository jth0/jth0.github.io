title: I’m reading on my Starbucks mocha cup, okay? The quote of the day… It was Madeleine
  Albright, former Secretary of State [crowd boos] and UN ambassador. … Now she said

<blockquote>I&rsquo;m reading on my Starbucks mocha cup, okay? The quote of the day&hellip; It was Madeleine Albright, former Secretary of State [crowd boos] and UN ambassador. &hellip; Now she said it, I didn&rsquo;t. She said, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a place in Hell reserved for women who don&rsquo;t support other women.&rsquo;</blockquote>&#8212;<p>The statement came after Palin had recounted a &ldquo;providential&rdquo; moment she experienced on Saturday. Except the quote is wrong.</p>

<p>The Huffington Post&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/05/palin-misquotes-albright_n_131967.html">article</a> continues:</p>

<blockquote>Palin seemed to realize that the line could be viewed as grating. As the audience cheered, she remarked: &ldquo;Okay, now, thank you so much for receiving that well. I didn&rsquo;t know how that was gonna go over. And now, California, let&rsquo;s see what a comment like I just made, how that is turned into whatever it&rsquo;ll be turned into tomorrow with the newspaper.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m guessing newspapers won&rsquo;t pick up that gaffe, but blogs have.
