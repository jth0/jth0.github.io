<p>Because Minnesotans don&rsquo;t leave and people are afraid to come here, due to the wild blizzards and impending popsicle state the visitor is about to enter. So the state is a little insulated. But seriously, I would love to know the root cause of this, because it really is only known in Minnesota as duck, duck, gray duck.</p>

<p>Goose! (You&rsquo;re it!)</p>
