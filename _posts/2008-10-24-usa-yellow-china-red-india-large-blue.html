<p>More or less, for the last 50 years, Afghanistan has been on the bottom-right of the global graph of life expectancy vs. number of offspring. They&rsquo;re moving up and left quickly, but this may explain part of why they&rsquo;ve been a &ldquo;hotbed&rdquo; of terrorist activity.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a good chance that Afghanistan&rsquo;s lack of movement is a result of incomplete data, as well, but I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
