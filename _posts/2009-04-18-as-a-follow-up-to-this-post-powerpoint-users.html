Then again after creating five presentations. And ten. And fifteen. (You get the point.)</p>

<p><a href="https://presentationzen.com">Garr</a> also points out a few times in this hour-long talk that you can learn a lot from watching videos from <a href="https://www.ted.com">TED</a>. Not only in presentation skill, but in the contents of those talks. So perhaps Microsoft could embed a TED video while you wait for PowerPoint to load, too.</p>
