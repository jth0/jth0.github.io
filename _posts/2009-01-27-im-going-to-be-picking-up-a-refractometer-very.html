<img src="/assets/post_files/TxUk6mAtEj8g6gxj2VcRePo8o1_1280.jpg"/><br/><p>I&rsquo;m going to be picking up a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001F07Z02?tag=synapsecollap-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B001F07Z02&amp;adid=0D8JEMV7F6DCXDKMGTN0&amp;">refractometer</a> very soon here. It measures the sugar content of a liquid in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brix">brix</a>, useful for checking out the health of fruits and vegetables, and especially useful in tracking the fermentation progress in beer- and wine-making. I&rsquo;ll post further once I get it and get to use it a little.</p>
