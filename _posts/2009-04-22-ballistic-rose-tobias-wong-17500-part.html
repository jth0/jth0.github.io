  <p><a href="https://www.citizen-citizen.com/collections/all/products/ballistic-rose">Ballistic Rose</a> - Tobias Wong - $175.00</p>
  
  <p>Part of the permanent collection of the MoMA New York, the now classic Ballistic Rose comes with certificate of provenance and archival [replica shotgun cartridge] collectors box.</p>
  
  <p>A classical decorative corsage, Tobias Wongs Ballistic Rose is a handmade ribbon rose constructed from a single strip of ballistic nylon. This floral hybrid protects your heart in an uncertain world. Wongs bloom is both a high-tech talisman for the tender-hearted and wry fashion statement.</p>
