<p>I think HP backed up over the shark with this one. Keep everything the same, to the point of using photographs for your interface, including the &ldquo;menu&rdquo; button and two function buttons. I&rsquo;m going to assume the menu even displays on the &ldquo;LCD&rdquo; &ldquo;just like the original!&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;But, but, but!&rdquo; they may exclaim, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve added features! Look, it has a <i>vertical</i> layout now! What an improvement, by gosh!&rdquo; </p>

<p>Imagine what a company like HP could do if they actually tried to innovate instead of replicating technologically-archaic past-successes, by golly.</p></div>
