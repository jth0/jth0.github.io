<blockquote>I realized how useful good interview questions are for gaining insight into what it might be like to work with someone. I feel like the point of the questions is not what your answer is so much as it is how you go about answering it and most important is that you have some kind of game plan for your career. There’s nothing worse than someone saying they have no idea where they want to be 10 years from now. Sure, it’s impossible to know but you have some kind of plan don’t you?</blockquote>

<p>Rob Haggart does a great job <a href="https://www.aphotoeditor.com/2008/10/17/interviewing-candidates-for-a-magazine-job/">explaining the basics</a> of the art of interviewing. <a href="https://www.firstsearch.com/RadRpts/ArtInt.htm">This page</a> goes into a lot more depth if you&rsquo;re into this sort of thing. If you check that second link, just make sure you re-read Rob&rsquo;s synopsis, as that&rsquo;s what it comes down to.</p>
