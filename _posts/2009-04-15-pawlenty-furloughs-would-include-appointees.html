<blockquote>
  <p>Two things are totally awesome about furloughs.  First, the very idea of a furlough is that you have employees that are being paid for non-essential work.  On top of that, if you’ve been working somewhere for more that 6-8 years, which is the case with many, many Boomers in all facets of the economy, you have a ton of vacation time.  Like a “the European countries are jealous” amount.  And you’re at 4 weeks of vacation and have to not work for 48 days, you’re pretty much part time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this plan would be used to cover T-Paw &amp; The Legislature&rsquo;s fiscal malfeasance by forcing state employees, who have nothing to do with the budget apart from being tax-paying citizens, to use their hard-earned vacation. Potentially, without regard to whether they&rsquo;re essential. (The definition of essential, by the way, means you can&rsquo;t do anything but <em>try</em> to keep the lights on.)</p>

<p>Oh, and for those in my boat, with the state less than six years or those who actually use their vacation time, well, we&rsquo;d get fucked. Awesome.</p>
