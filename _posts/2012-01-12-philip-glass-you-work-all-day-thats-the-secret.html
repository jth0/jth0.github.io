<blockquote><p>“You get up early in the morning and you work all day. That’s the only secret.”</p>
<p>— <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Glass">Philip Glass</a>, an American composer. One of the highest profile composers writing “classical” music today, he is often said to be one of the most influential composers of the late 20th century. His music is also often (controversially) described as <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalist_music" title="Minimalist music" class="mw-redirect">minimalist</a></i>, along with the work of the other “major minimalists” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Monte_Young" title="La Monte Young">La Monte Young</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Riley" title="Terry Riley">Terry Riley</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reich" title="Steve Reich">Steve Reich</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>This caught my eye because I’ve had his music on heavy rotation lately, but check this out: the <a href="https://prettyawfulgiraffes.wordpress.com/2011/05/16/american-composer-philip-glass/">source</a> of the image is a blog named <a href="https://prettyawfulgiraffes.wordpress.com/about/">Giraffes Drawn By People Who Should Not Be Drawing Giraffes</a>, which bills itself as “the only website dedicated exclusively to giraffes drawn by people who should not be drawing giraffes.” There is indeed a giraffe drawn by Philip Glass, who most certainly should not be drawing giraffes.</p>

<p>My faith in the internet is restored.</p></blockquote>
