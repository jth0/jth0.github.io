<blockquote>Above all else, write secure web applications.</blockquote>&#8212;<p><a href="https://broadcast.oreilly.com/2008/11/20-rules-for-amazon-cloud-security.html">George Reese, over at O'Reilly Broadcast</a>, on securing applications in the cloud. </p>

<p>Uh, George, that entire list applies to all systems and applications, not just cloud-based computing. Thanks for the tips though, now get onto the 1,000 posts that will actually help a poor developer implement those 20 pie-in-the-sky ideas. [ed: I had to work very hard not to say &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; there. You&rsquo;re welcome.]</p>
