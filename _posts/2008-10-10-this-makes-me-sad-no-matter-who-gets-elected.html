No matter who gets elected, we&rsquo;re fucked as a country because neither side can listen or think clearly. And where is the &ldquo;get a job&rdquo; thing coming from? I am socially liberal so I&rsquo;m not employed? Is the irony lost that the folks yelling get a job are standing in line, not working?</p>

<p>Facts: Obama is not socialist, communist, muslim or a terrorist. Neither is Biden.</p>

<p>Facts: McCain is not the devil or evil. Neither is Palin.</p>

<p>Ultimately, both candidates are qualified and experienced enough for this job. Both candidates hold nearly identical stances on all issues. Not just one or two, but <strong>all</strong> issues. And neither candidate really has a clue how to get us out of this economic shit-hole we&rsquo;re all sitting in together&hellip;not that either candidate has the authority or opportunity to do much other than provide sound bites.</p>

<p>Supporters of both candidates are still human. Hate-filled, judgmental and hunting for easy black &amp; white answers to eliminate that [sinister voice] dangerous gray middle-ground. [/sinister voice] We&rsquo;ll see if either candidate is qualified or capable of unifying the citizens of the US ever again. {<a href="https://twitter.com/dooce/statuses/954442226">via</a>}</p>
