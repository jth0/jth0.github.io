What&rsquo;s that? You thought that happened? No, not quite.</p>

<p>This is another video that leaves out some of the intricacies and depth behind these actions. Probably for the sake of simplicity, but also for the sake of FUD (that&rsquo;s fear, uncertainty and doubt). The more you can freak out the viewer, the more we see support for lining up and writing blank checks as part of our bailout.</p>

<p>Either way, the bailout is the equivalent of using a band aid to heal a decapitation. The checks our government is writing won&rsquo;t mean much if we can no longer get credit on the global market. All the economic strength and might this country has built over the past 50-100 years could be flushed in short order due to some insanely irresponsible investments made over the past 15 years by everyone. Not just wall street, but main street too.</p>

<p>That said, we still have to try something. I just hope our individual actions and the actions of our elected officials are deeper and more forward-looking than &ldquo;write the check and let the next guy fix it.&rdquo; If that happens&ndash;if D.C. and Wall Street continue business as usual&ndash;we&rsquo;re all fucked.</p>
