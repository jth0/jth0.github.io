<p>Holy sweet mother. Am I the last to see this?</p>
<p>Not sure I’ve ever seen Dave ask a band to play out like that.</p>
<p><strong>The Heavy</strong> : <em>How You Like Me Now? </em>(Letterman, January 18 2010)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Umm, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;How <i>Do</i> You Like Me Now?&rdquo;, and very much, thank you. Also, no, I have never seen David do that with another band. The Heavy is definitely deserving of the honor, and the rest of their album <b>also</b> rocks. <a href="https://astore.amazon.com/synapsecollap-20/detail/B002MFU9BG">Go buy it off Amazon for $5.99 now.</a></p>
