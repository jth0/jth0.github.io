<p>I struggle with sleeping in much more than she so I’m often the first one up and certainly the first one in the kitchen. She’s a coffee drinker where I prefer tea or juice most mornings but I still love to ritualistically pull down the burr grinder, carafe and French press from their top shelf and start a kettle. I fill the carafe with water as hot as the tap will allow, fill the grinder with a predetermined amount of beans and pulverize. &hellip; I empty the warmed carafe, plunge the press and transfer the fresh brew. I pour her a cup, no cream or sugar, and return to find her sitting up, rubbing her eyes. She always smiles, looks up with those beautiful eyes, hands outstretched. She takes a sip and tells me she loves me.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is more or less my morning routine, but we both prefer coffee&ndash;black for me, cream for her&ndash;and we take turns with the first-awake duties of making and serving. And she isn&rsquo;t obsessed with temperature or preheating.</p>
