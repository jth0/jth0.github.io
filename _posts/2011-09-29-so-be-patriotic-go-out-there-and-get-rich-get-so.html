title: So be Patriotic. Go out there and get rich. Get so obnoxiously rich that when
  that tax bill comes , your first thought will be to choke on how big a check you
  have to write. Your 2nd thought will be “what a great problem to have”, and your
  3rd should be a recognition that in paying your taxes you are helping to support
  millions of Americans that are not as fortunate as you.
