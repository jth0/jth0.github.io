<img src="/assets/post_files/tumblr_l4g6k2WXSg1qz7egyo1_500.png"/><br/><p>&ldquo;Equilibrium,&rdquo; 22 June 2010.</p>

<p>Wife and I: MSP.<br/>
Mom &amp; Pops: ATL.<br/>
Bro: BGW.</p>

<p>This is the first time we&rsquo;ve all been within five degrees of each other since I started looking. Or since January, when Bro was last home. He comes home again in a matter of weeks. This makes me overjoyed, if it&rsquo;s actually possible to be too happy. Which I doubt it is.</p>
