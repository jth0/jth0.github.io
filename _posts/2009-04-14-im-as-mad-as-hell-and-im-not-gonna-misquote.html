<p>Below, I post a thought in response to Neven&rsquo;s post. But first, this message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Howard Beale&rsquo;s &ldquo;Im as mad as hell and I&rsquo;m not going to take this anymore&rdquo; always gets quoted as &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <em>mad</em> as hell and I&rsquo;m not going to take <em>it</em> anymore.&rdquo;</p>
  
  <p>It&rsquo;s not a particularly bad <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_famous_misquotations">misquote</a>, but I still wonder how this sort of thing happens. I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s any specific parody of this scene which misquotes it. Friends I&rsquo;ve introduced to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074958/">the movie</a> use the wrong wording after one viewing. So maybe something about that arrangement of words flows better, some vague pattern of the English language, some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6srOAqpqj0">popcultural</a> memory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The movie itself, around 4:19 in the clip above, misquotes as the scenes cut to people getting up and yelling at home. That is repeated multiple times, and perhaps is the more emotional portion of this scene, inciting goosebumps and reflective thoughts and so on. My own reflective thought: it&rsquo;s sad how true this scene and message still feel. I&rsquo;ve never seen <em>Network</em>, but it&rsquo;s added to my queue.</p>

<p>What do you think of this scene?</p>
