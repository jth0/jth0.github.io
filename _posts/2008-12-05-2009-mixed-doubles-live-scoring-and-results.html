<p>Team Hoffoss (hey, that&rsquo;s us!) play on the odd draws. We lost our first game this morning, making our record 1-2 so far, with four more to play, after walking in the door as our practice time was about to start. Whoops. So off on the wrong foot, we were able to pick up a couple points in the early game, but never came back after the fourth end break. Team Gebert actually had a chance at six points in the fourth end, but they didn&rsquo;t see it or just didn&rsquo;t go for it, which I appreciate!</p>
