title: But the scarcity of truly crappy subprime-mortgage bonds no longer mattered.
  The big Wall Street firms had just made it possible to short even the tiniest and
  most obscure subprime-mortgage-backed bond by creating, in effect, a market of side
  bets. Instead of shorting the actual BBB bond, you could now enter into an agreement
  for a credit-default swap with Deutsche Bank or Goldman Sachs. It cost money to
  make this side bet, but nothing like what it cost to short the stocks, and the upside
  was far greater.

<p>How true Michael is. The cost, as we&rsquo;re finding out, is far, far greater than if investors had simply been shorting stocks and hedging investments. A very good read.</p>
