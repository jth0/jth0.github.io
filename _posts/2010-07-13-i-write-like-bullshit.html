<p>There&rsquo;s something very wrong with the site <a href="https://iwl.me/">I Write Like</a>&hellip;Dan Brown!? Are you kidding me? Bite me, IWL.</p>

<p>It seems a longer sample turns out something a lot less insulting&hellip;one post reports I write like Vladimir Nabokov, two James Joyce&rsquo;s and an H.P. Lovecraft. Those ones are a little insulting too, but more to Nabokov, Joyce and Lovecraft. But Dan Brown? That&rsquo;s a bit of a low blow.</p>
