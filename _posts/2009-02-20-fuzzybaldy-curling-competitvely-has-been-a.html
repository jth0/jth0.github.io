  <p>Curling competitvely has been a main past time for 15 years of my life and 2 weeks ago our team (Team O’Leary) qualified to compete at the <a href="https://www.usacurl.org/curlingrocks/">2009 Women’s National Championship/2010 Olympic Trials</a>! We are one of ten women’s teams competing for the chance to represent the USA in the 2009 Worlds and then the 2010 Vancouver Games!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s my wife posting on our shared blog that we haven&rsquo;t really started posting on quite yet. Click through to find more details on how to follow along as she attempts to become the 2009 national <em><strong>CHAMPION AND AN OLYMPIAN IN THE 2010 OLYMPICS!</strong></em></p>

<p>(Can you tell I&rsquo;m pretty excited for her? I&rsquo;d even use the &lt;blink&gt; tag if that still worked&hellip;)</p>
