<blockquote><p>this makes my head hurt.  if state workers could do the jobs of consultants, they wouldn’t need to bring in consultants.  but guess what.  a lot of state workers have been state workers for 20+ years and haven’t upgraded their skill set, which is why we now spend so much on consultants.</p>
<p>of all the battles to pick with the Paw, this is a poor one.</p></blockquote>

<p>This makes my head hurt, too. And it is not a bright idea. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a battle with T-Paw, per se. The <a href="https://john.hoffoss.com/post/96459460">talks of furlough</a> are gone, at least. The primary reason this is totally ridiculous is that state workers are very carefully scoped into a job. Projects are undertaken only when they can be properly staffed. Some projects that will only require six months of one person&rsquo;s time is contracted out. The ongoing operation is not. If this were enacted, in the end nothing would get done until budgets recuperated and projects were funded again. Horrible, terrible idea.</p>
