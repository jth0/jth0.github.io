title: But Skype is at a strange crossroads. When eBay bought Skype for $2.6 billion
  in 2005, the online auction company apparently only licensed — didn’t buy — the
  software code that makes Skype run. Now, Skype’s founders, who are no longer with
  the company and who own the code through their new company, Joltid, [which has to
  have one of the most generic websites ever,] are trying to terminate that license.
  The legal battle is supposed to reach a British court by June 2010, and if Joltid
  prevails, eBay said in an S.E.C. filing that “the continued operation of Skype’s
  business as currently conducted would likely not be possible.”

<p>Who in their right mind would buy a <strong>software service</strong> company for $2.6 billion, but not buy the software in that deal!? Ridiculous.</p>
