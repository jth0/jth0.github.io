Essentially, this is insurance against a bond. If you buy a bond and the bond-holder fails to pay out, your CDS will pay out. AIG sold a lot of these to a lot of people, without regard to the risk exposure that comes with selling an insurance instrument of this nature.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSMAR85972720080918?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0&amp;sp=true">click-through article</a> from Reuters provides an excellent explanation of this situation, how the subprime mortgage market led us here, the repercussions of AIG folding, and justification for the US federal government&rsquo;s bailout.</p>

<p>This makes me less annoyed at the bailout and much, much, much more annoyed with the thoughtless, laissez-faire behavior that lead the global economy down this rat-hole.</p>
