<a href="https://tomelko.com/blog/2009/04/20/comment-via-cullect/">Tom Elko's different take on commenting systems.</a><br/><p>My buddy @tomelko came up with this neat idea for blog comment management. Read all about it over on his site. In short, the idea is: don&rsquo;t manage comments. Don&rsquo;t accept comments. Provide an alternative mechanism for commenting and discussion in response to your content.</p>
