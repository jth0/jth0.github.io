Wifey and I met [on a blind-date] on the third of the month. We married on the third, which also happened to be Labor Day. I only messed up in not proposing on the third. Ever since we celebrated our first month, (a cheesy event, as these are wont to be) we decided to try a new restaurant that neither of us had visited before. Every month since, on or around the third, we go-a-hunting for a new restaurant to try.

<p>This month was <a href="https://www.surabhicuisine.com/">Surabhi</a> in Bloomington, MN. While we normally try to avoid buffets for that dangerous post-buffet desire to explode/pass out, this one was worth the risk. We both did pretty well in terms of not indulging in every delicious dish available. A fried and curried cauliflower was notable, and the mutton was tender and moist. The lunch buffet is certainly worth a second trip. </p>
