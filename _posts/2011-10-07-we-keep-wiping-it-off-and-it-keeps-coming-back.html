<blockquote>We keep wiping it off, and it keeps coming back. We think it’s benign. But we just don’t know.</blockquote>&#8212;<p>A virus that: A) knows about Predator and Reaper drone control systems; B) finds it&rsquo;s way to drone control workstations; and C) keeps coming back? Yeah, I&rsquo;m going to go ahead and say that this is not &ldquo;benign&rdquo; by any stretch. (Don&rsquo;t forget these drones now often have bombs attached to them&hellip;)</p>

<p>An unnamed source familiar with a virus that’s infected America’s Predator and Reaper drones <a href="https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/10/virus-hits-drone-fleet/all/1">tells Wired</a> it’s ”logging pilots’ every keystroke as they remotely fly missions over Afghanistan and other warzones.” <em>Sweet Jesus</em>.
