<img src="/assets/post_files/TxUk6mAtEnpmyessgts3MnH6o1_250.png"/><br/><p>In what I hope will be one of my last meta posts, I think tumbulartiy is basically just a pavlovian &ldquo;tumbl, then get some -ularitys.&rdquo; It is distracting at best, and at worst, directly responsible for the increase in mindless drivel being posted to what once were good tumblogs.</p>

<p>Dammit. You see what I mean? You see what tumbluarity just made me do in that last paragraph? Shame on you, tumbuilarty.</p>
