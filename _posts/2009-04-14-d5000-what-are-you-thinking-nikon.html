<blockquote>
  <p>If youâ€™re considering an entry-level Nikon D.S.L.R., you might want to aim higher. The company has just announced the D5000, a model that bridges the gap between its popular D60 and D90 models by offering features like high-definition video capture, a larger sensor, an 11-point auto-focus, and Live View at a reasonable price of $849.

<p><em>Ahem</em>. Bridging an approximate gap of $500, landing on the higher end of that gap, of course. And that&rsquo;s 720p HD, presumably the same performance as the D90, which means don&rsquo;t even think about video unless you&rsquo;re on a tripod using a VR (vibration-reduction) lens.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The D5000 is built upon the small chassis of the D60 (which costs approximately $600) but adds many of the finer attributes of the D90 (now selling for roughly $1,200, with lens). The 12.3-megapixel D5000 employs the same sensor as the D90, for instance, and it offers the same 11-point auto-focus system (the D60 has only three AF points). That means the D5000 will provide faster and more accurate auto-focus than the D60.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ugh. What the hell are you thinking, Nikon? This tiny gap did not need to be filled by a camera that takes the biggest drawback of the D60, namely it&rsquo;s chassis (which lacks an auto-focus motor for non-AF-S lenses, or lenses with built-in auto-focus motors). The video is nice, but the D90 body is about the same price.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The D5000 also packs a whopping 19 automatic scene modes (as compared with 5 on the D90) as well as several new in-camera editing features, including a soft filter effect to smooth out faces and a perspective control that enables users to correct distortions of up to 10 percent that often appear in architectural photographs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whopping&rdquo;!? Are you retarded? I wonder what icon they&rsquo;ll use for &ldquo;Indoor Stadium - Picture of the Game&rdquo; mode vs. &ldquo;Retractable Roof Stadium, Closed - Picture of the Game.&rdquo; No one needs 19 automatic modes. The owner will need the manual to figure out which mode is &ldquo;right&rdquo;. But you already know everyone will just take the fully-automatic mode 95% of the time. Not to mention the fact that the group you&rsquo;re marketing this to, the advanced amateur, (or people with money to burn?) should be using an aperture- or shutter-priority mode when shooting 100% of the time.</p>

<p>Argh. Nikon, you needed to close the $1,500 gap between the D90 and the D700 with a full-HD camera that provides video output equivalent to the Canon 5D mark II. And preferably, keeping it a cropped sensor so you still have that strong delineation between cropped sensors and full-frame sensors. Better low-light performance for still photography and video would be a bonus, but I won&rsquo;t push my luck.</p>
