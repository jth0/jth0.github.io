<p>From a note sent this morning by Jeff &amp; Cathie Williamson:</p>

<blockquote><em>Porterfest begins tonight at Flat Earth Brewing Company! We are releasing a new flavored porter growler each week until the end of the year. This week we are featuring Starman Porter, Cygnus X-1 porter blended with star anise. We will update the website with our other porter offerings. Growler sales are from 3:30 â€“ 6:30 every Thursday, except Thanksgiving week, we will be selling growlers on Wednesday the 25th.</em></blockquote>

<p>Intriguing. Star anise / black licorice doesn&rsquo;t do a ton for me, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to what else Jeff comes up with in the coming weeks. Git sum!</p>
