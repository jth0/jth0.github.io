title: I cannot stand when someone bases their entire campaign for a government position
  on their religious beliefs…[our government is] designed to adapt to the times and
  the will of it’s people…That’s what I’m fighting to protect. So someone who’s so
  hellbent (irony?) on brining jesus into the whitehouse, well, no thanks. I’d rather
  see Jessie Ventura take up the oval office. With Hulk Hogan as his VP.

And Giuliani also scares the ever-living shit out of me. Some of the dead shit, too. [James&rsquo; full post <a href="https://blog.jhoffoss.net/?p=5">here</a>.]
