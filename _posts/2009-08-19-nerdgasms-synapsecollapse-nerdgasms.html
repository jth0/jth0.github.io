<p>Where is this door? I love this door. I want to go on a pilgrimage to visit this door. &lt;3</p>

<p>This is [6 rue du lac](<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fonk/364749532/"></a><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fonk/364749532/">https://www.flickr.com/photos/fonk/364749532/</a>) in Brussels, Belgium.</p>

<p>I love how you just knew that. Is this a lankmark for art noveau nerds? Have I failed at life?</p></blockquote>

<p>Hardly. I just came across that awhile ago on Flickr and fav&rsquo;d it. You&rsquo;re not the first person I&rsquo;ve come across who asked &ldquo;where is this?&rdquo; Aside from the car, I I prefer [this photo](<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fonk/364749537/">https://www.flickr.com/photos/fonk/364749537/</a>) fonk took of this home, as the building itself is a work of art.</p>

<p>Whence I make it Belgium, this will be a stop for me with a better camera than a phone&rsquo;s to capture some of the detail in the glass and brick on this wonderful home.</p>
