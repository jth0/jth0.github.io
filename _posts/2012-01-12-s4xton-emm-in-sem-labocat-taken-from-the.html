<p>Taken from the Honest Girl Scouts campaign. For a campaign trying to get people /not/ to buy cookies and /not/ support the GSUSA, this is doing an awful lot to suddenly make me want /to/ support the GSUSA. (and I’m saying this a a former Girl Scout of about 6 years who hasn’t bought cookies in years because they’re too expensive). </p>
<p>I see so much acceptance here, and especially in a time in children’s lives where acceptance is so important, taking that away from them is just cruel.</p>

<p><strong><em>BUY ALL THE COOKIES!</em></strong></p>

<p>And now I’m more interested in Girl Scout Cookies.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is exactly the kind of dangerous activity that we all knew the girl scouts were engaged in: trying to incentivize each of us to further fatten ourselves for a number of very, very good reasons. I&rsquo;ll be buying every damn box of thin mints I can get my hands on.</p>
