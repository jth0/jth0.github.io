<p>I am cautiously thrilled to have a President that I am not [yet] embarrassed by. I think I&rsquo;ll be wearing an American flag next time I travel abroad (sorry, Canada). Now is when we really need Hope though, that Obama does not turn out to be yet another politician playing behind party lines.</p>
