<img src="/assets/post_files/TxUk6mAtEj4e2on00zpmyr2Ao1_1280.jpg"/><br/><p>This was my first batch of homebrew. <em>After losing this information for one of my batches, I&rsquo;m posting my notes on each batch of beer I&rsquo;ve brewed to share, and to document my progress and alterations to each recipe.</em></p>

<h1><a href="https://northernbrewer.com/alekits.html">St. Paul Porter</a> kit # 1091 from Northern Brewer. {<a href="https://www.northernbrewer.com/promash/1091_.html">ProMash Recipe</a>}</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many consider porter to be a light-bodied stout. This is certainly not true of this beer. In formulating our St. Paul Porter recipe, we have considered the defining element of a porter to be the prodigious use of chocolate malt, which lends a deep red color, and a smooth, almost nutty flavor.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Specialty Grains</h2>

<ul>
<li>0.5 lbs. Simpson&rsquo;s Chocolate</li>
<li>0.5 lbs. Simpson&rsquo;s Dark Crystal</li>
</ul>

<li>1 oz. Cascade @ 1 min.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Yeast</h2>

<ul>
<li>Wyeast #1187 <em>Ringwood Ale Yeast</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Stats</h2>

<ul>
<li>Brewed: 1 February 2008.</li>
<li>O.G.: 1052, right where the kit said it should be.</li>
<li>Bottled: 29 March 2008.</li>
<li>F.G.: 1022, around 4.5% ABV.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>Drank most of this way too soon, but no surprises there as this was batch numero uno. The last case was much smoother and more balanced after having been conditioned sufficiently. Last few bottles that were set aside were top-notch.</p>

<h2>Lessons</h2>

<p>Time helps.</p>
