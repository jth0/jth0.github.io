<blockquote>
  <p>This microscape image was digitally stitched togather from multiple (FEI) field emission gun scans or more commonly know (SEM) Scanning Electron Microscope scans.</p>
  
  <p>The base surface in this picture is made of highly aligned, dense zinc oxide nanorods, which were grown inside a tube furnace system by oxidizing zinc foil at temperature of 500-600 Celsius degree. The higher, complex structures are also made from zinc oxide, which were grown from by absorbing the reactants from the vapor.</p>
  
  <p>Concept for Image by UGA Fine Art Associate Professor Michael Oliveri. FEI scans taken and assembled by Michael Oliveri</p>
  
  <p>Nano structures created by UGA Physics and Engineering Assistant Professor Dr. Zhengwei Pan, along with his post-doctoral research associates Dr. Zhanjun Gu and Dr. Feng Liu.</p>
