<p>From the <a href="https://www.mnhealthplan.org/principles.html">campaign for the Minnesota Health Plan</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Minnesota Health Act is driven by the need for solutions that work and not by ideology. The solutions are based on over-arching principles of health care reform.</p>
  
  <p>In order to develop a plan that keeps Minnesotans healthy and provides the best
  quality of health care, the Minnesota Health Care Plan will:</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p>ensure all Minnesotans receive high quality health care, regardless of their income;</p></li>
<li><p>not restrict, delay, or deny care or reduce the quality of care to hold down costs, but instead reduce costs through prevention, efficiency, and reduction of bureaucracy;</p></li>
<li><p>cover all necessary care, including all coverage currently required by law, complete mental health services, chemical dependency treatment, prescription drugs, medical equipment and supplies, dental care, long-term care, and home care services;</p></li>
<li><p>allow patients to choose their own providers;</p></li>
<li><p>be funded through premiums and other payments based on the person&rsquo;s ability to pay, so as not to deny full access to any Minnesota resident;</p></li>
<li><p>focus on preventive care and early intervention to improve the health of all Minnesota residents and reduce costs from untreated illnesses and diseases;</p></li>
<li><p>ensure an adequate number of qualified health care professionals and facilities to guarantee availability of, and timely access to quality care throughout the state;</p></li>
<li><p>continue Minnesota&rsquo;s leadership in medical education, training, research, and technology; and</p></li>
<li><p>provide adequate and timely payments to providers.</p></li>
</ol>
