I&rsquo;ll be curling in Two Harbors this weekend in the US Mixed Doubles nationals. I expect to get cleaned off the ice, especially in our first game against Olympian and defending Mixed Doubles champion Jamie Haskell and her husband Corrie. But I&rsquo;m going to have a blast while doing so. I&rsquo;ll post details on how you can follow along as I get them. For now, the draw list [schedule] is <a href="https://www.usacurl.org/curlingrocks/images/Draws/draw.md.08.pdf">here</a> (we&rsquo;re team Hoffoss), and you can email my teammate and I <a href="mailto:teamhoffoss@usacurl.org">here</a>.</p>
