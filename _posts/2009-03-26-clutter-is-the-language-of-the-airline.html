title: "[Clutter] is the language of the airline stewardess demonstrating the oxygen
  mask that will drop down if the plane should somehow run out of air. “In the extremely
  unlikely possibility that the aircraft should experience such an eventuality,” she
  begins—a phrase so oxygen-depriving in itself that we are prepared for any disaster,
  and even gasping death shall lose its sting. As for her request to “kindly extinguish
  all smoking materials,” I often wonder what materials are smoking. Maybe she thinks
  my coat and tie are on fire."
