<p>&hellip; maybe more businesses should offer health insurance. Just sayin. </p></blockquote>

<p>So much wrong here. What kind of grocery store pays their employees $50k, and why aren&rsquo;t any of this owner&rsquo;s ten employees outlined? They don&rsquo;t have healthcare and actually make $15k (minimum wage $7.25, effective next Friday), not $50k. (By the way, did you know that back in the mid-90&rsquo;s, when minimum wage was around $5, a livable wage was considered $10/hr or $20k/yr?)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m gonna say that a single employee making $80k/yr with no health insurance is A: a dope who&rsquo;s gonna get healthcare, and B: either overworked, overpaid, or both.</p>

<p>And the Wall Streeter? I really can&rsquo;t even put into words how little I care about your well-being, after you&rsquo;ve so clearly demonstrated the same by perpetually flushing our economy with your short-sighted, profit-over-all-else motives to invest in anything so long as it makes someone a little money.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never lived in New York, but somehow I doubt that any of these &ldquo;examples&rdquo; are remotely close to the norm. Perhaps the norm for the sub-5% target of these ads to outline the evil taxes, though. I&rsquo;ll be in the back yard, crying my eyes out for those poor, poor $1.5-million-combined-income couples.</p>

<p>Edit: What could possibly make this even better? It&rsquo;s authored by Gary Milkwick, owner of Milkwick &amp; Associates, a tax accounting firm, and according to the ad: &ldquo;of the Tax Club.&rdquo; The Tax Club is another tax accounting firm that you can &ldquo;join&rdquo; as a &ldquo;member&rdquo; and get the tax secrets of the wealthy! And they must be legit and smart and good because their office is in the Empire State Building! Give me a friggin&rsquo; break.</p>
