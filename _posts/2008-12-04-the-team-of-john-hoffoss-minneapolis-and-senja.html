title: The team of John Hoffoss (Minneapolis) and Senja Lopac (Champlin, Minn.) got
  their first win with an 8-7 defeat of Steve Pickle (Fargo, N.D.) and Madonna Fitzgerald
  (West Fargo, N.D.). Pickle and Fitzgerald held the early edge but Hoffoss experienced
  a little luck in the fourth end to take the lead. After falling as he slid out of
  the hack, Hoffoss decided to throw the stone anyway and ended up wicking off of
  one of his own stones and scoring three points. The game eventually went down to
  the wire with Pickle missing his final shot attempt, giving the win to Hoffoss and
  Lopac.

<p>Posting scores for all four was too much work. Perhaps tomorrow?</p>
