  <p>Allowing collaboration that doesn&rsquo;t need servers belong to evil-bad strangers. &hellip; At Opera, we want to put <em>you</em> on the web, so that <em>hackers</em> can interact directly with <em>you</em>  when they want, <em>how</em> they want. Welcome to <a href="https://unite.opera.com/">Opera Unite</a>, the web you know, just even less secure.</p>
