  McCain’s rejoinders rang so false that they might’ve hurt him even more than the initial exchange. I know how to get Osama bin Laden, he said. Shouldn’t he share whether or not he’s elected? And when I talked about bombing Iran, he said, I was just joking with a veteran friend. Oh. I guess you had to be there. The point isn’t whether he actually wants to bomb the country, it’s that joking about that topic is utterly inappropriate.

  I leave this debate convinced that neither man will adopt domestic policies that I like, and that I’ll be voting on temperament and foreign policy.

<p>I leave this debate convinced that neither man will adopt domestic policies that I like, and that I’ll be voting on temperament and foreign policy.</p></blockquote>&#8212;<p><a href="https://www.culture11.com/article/32704">This series of four essays</a> lays out our position this election as US citizens and does a fair job of explaining why, no matter how viscerally conservative or voraciously liberal any of us are, none of us are satisfied. The truest losers might be those like myself who sit in the middle and have choice of two nearly-identical candidates, neither of which has a truly complete platform, and both of which have had their fair share of electoral goofs in this campaign.</p>

<p>As one of the essays in the linked article lays out, the Republican Party will need to do some serious strategery; I hope they come back stronger than McCain/Palin. Perhaps someone who is actually fiscally conservative that will allow the free market to do what it&rsquo;s supposed to do and not propose things like $700 billion dollar bail-outs to save Wall Street&rsquo;s ass. Free markets only work when you let them fail if they&rsquo;ve dug their own grave. On the other end, the Democratic Party will most likely spend their time celebrating their victory over the Evil Party and get pwned (that&rsquo;s ridiculously defeated for you non-h4x0r types) in the next election. (Having a candidate not be over the age of 70 will help you here.)</p>

<p>Goodness do I wish we had run-off voting and some actual alternative parties in this country.</p>
