  <p>You see that business card? Cheap. Strathmore stock. 60 lb. Holds a crease. Can you tear it? Absolutely. Looks like crap? It is crap. &hellip; That card looks like crap, too. One color! Nothin&rsquo; special about it!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hey, I think have one of those cards&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My card is die cut. My card is foil stamped. My card is embossed. My card is a pop-up! Isn&rsquo;t this cute? See the little guy, he pops up and waves at you when you read my card!</p>

<p>My check is in the mail. Is yours?</p>
