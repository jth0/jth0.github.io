<p>Duly noted for the CSA plannings. While this guide could probably formatted a little better to help you find what you want, I&rsquo;ll give a hearty recommendation for Ploughshare Farm and Featherstone Farm, who my wife and I went with last year. The year before, we went with another, which I can&rsquo;t recall right now, but they were also very good. Ploughshare wound up being a better deal for us in the end, but your mileage may vary. And the fruit &amp; vegetables from Featherstone? I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll find a better deal. There&rsquo;s nothing like fresh pears as late as November, and we still have squash left from our last share! CSAs FTW.</p>
