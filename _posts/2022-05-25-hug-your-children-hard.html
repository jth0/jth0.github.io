Guns are now the <a href="https://theweek.com/school-shootings/1013846/firearms-are-now-the-leading-cause-of-death-for-us-children">leading cause of death in children</a>. Where, and when, do we get off this ride and control guns in a meaningful way? Fuck gun-clutching hicks and stand-your-ground and castle doctrine and conceal &amp; carry and <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/trump-cruz-abbott-nra-meeting-17196580.php">Trump and Cruz and Abbott</a> and the <a href="https://www.nraila.org/articles/20220512/president-trump-to-speak-at-2022-nra-annual-meeting">NRA</a>. Fuck all of it.</p>
