Go there for more details. I am not a rollergirl, but I enjoy their bouts, and you will too, if only you went!</p>

<h1>Saturday, February 28th</h1>

<h1>Doors at 6:30pm, bout at 7:30pm</h1>

<h1>Roy Wilkins Auditorium, St. Paul</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pre-show featuring Rince na Chroi Irish Dancers.
  Atomic Bombshells vs. Garda Belts
  Half-time entertainment by Dust &lsquo;N&rsquo; Bones. 
  Dagger Dolls vs. Rockits
  After-party at Station 4. Go there to hobnob with your favorite rollergirls, enjoy PBR drink specials, and see more of Dust 'N&rsquo; Bones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>GET THERE EARLY, GET A FREEBIE
We&rsquo;ll be giving away a special limited edition Minnesota RollerGirls t-shirt to the first 200 people in the doors. There will also be a very limited quantity (just 25) for sale for $15 and when they&rsquo;re gone, they&rsquo;re gone. So get there early!</p>

<p>GET A BLACK EYE OR SHOW YOUR TEAM SPIRIT
Get old fashioned black eyes for a buck at our Black Eye Booth &hellip; OR support your favorite home team for just a $2 donation. (Kids always free!) If you think we&rsquo;ve done an exceptional job, a more generous donation is always appreciated. All proceeds go to the bout charity, Avenues For Homeless Youth.</p>
