<p>We (Team Hoffoss) won the <em>last stone draw</em>, meaning we started with hammer against Jamie and Nate Haskell, the defending champions. We started off putting up two points, which made for a nice start to the game. Jamie came back with three in the second, then we put two more up in the third. Jamie came back with four in the fourth, one in the fifth and three in the sixth. We eked one more rock in the seventh, before Jamie shut us down with three in the eighth. We had no rocks in play by the end of the eighth, so there was little chance of a comeback on our part.</p>
