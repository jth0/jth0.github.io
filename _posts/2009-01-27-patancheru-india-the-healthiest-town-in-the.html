  <p>Medical researchers have found that some of the streams, rivers, and groundwater in Patancheru, India, are really &ldquo;a soup of 21 different active pharmaceutical ingredients, used in generics for treatment of hypertension, heart disease, chronic liver ailments, depression, gonorrhea, ulcers and other ailments. Half of the drugs measured at the highest levels of pharmaceuticals ever detected in the environment.&rdquo;</p>
