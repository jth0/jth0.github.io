  <p>Part of me wonders if these parents are doing this for the convenience, or if they simply can’t take the thought of spending a significant amount of time alone with their kids.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what&rsquo;s wrong with this country.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For decades, parents in the Northeast who sent their children to summer camp faced the same arduous logistics of traveling long distances to remote towns in Maine, New Hampshire and upstate New York to pick up their children or to attend parents’ visiting day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Arduous? Are you kidding me? &ldquo;Oh, dang, we have to go spend time with Ana. The poor girl can&rsquo;t even get two N&rsquo;s in her name! Hun, hurry and book our jet so we don&rsquo;t have to go on those awful roads.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now, even as the economy limps along, more of the nation’s wealthier families are cutting out the car ride and chartering planes to fly to summer camps. One private jet broker, Todd Rome of Blue Star Jets, said his summer-camp business had jumped 30 percent over the last year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty soon, those few who drive will be seen as quaint Thoreaus hunting for their Walden as they plod along for four hours to camp in their Bentleys. Or they&rsquo;ll be busy trying to appear as though they actually <em>chose</em> to drive like a commoner, but the others will see through this vail, knowing full-well they are jet-less imposters well outside their station.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to go vomit.</p>
