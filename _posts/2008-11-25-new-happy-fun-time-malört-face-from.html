<p>From Wikipedia: &ldquo;Malört, a distilled beverage, is the name of a Swedish style of schnapps called &quot;Beska Droppar&rdquo;, flavored with wormwood. The word malört is the Swedish word for the wormwood plant. The smell and taste is musty and extremely bitter.&ldquo;</p>

<blockquote>Most first-time drinkers of Jeppson Malort reject our liquor. Its strong, sharp taste is not for everyone. Our liquor is rugged and unrelenting (even brutal) to the palate. During almost 60 years of American distribution, we found only 1 out of 49 men will drink Jeppson Malort. During the lifetime of our founder, Carl Jeppson was apt to say, &quot;My Malort is produced for that unique group of drinkers who disdain light flavor or neutral spirits.&rdquo;

It is not possible to forget our two-fisted liquor. The taste just lingers and lasts - seemingly forever. The first shot is hard to swallow! PERSERVERE [sic]. Make it past two &lsquo;shock-glasses&rsquo; and with the third you could be ours&hellip;forever.</blockquote>
