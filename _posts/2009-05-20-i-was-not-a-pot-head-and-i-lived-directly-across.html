<p>Wow, this place brings back memories.  I used to practically live across the street from this store, at my friend’s pothead brother’s apartment where we would stumble to sleep it off after a night of underage drinking/dancing.</p>
<p>Santana’s had the BEST chicken strips and sauce that you could get at 3:00 in the morning.  Not that there was a lot of competition at that time of night.</p>{<a href="https://glory-fades.tumblr.com/post/110500928/weeks101-santana-via-dan-anderson-wow-this">glory-fades</a>}</blockquote>
