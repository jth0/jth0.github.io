<p>Guys, this is gonna rock a lot. Gals, you&rsquo;re gonna rock a lot, too.</p>

<blockquote><p>Here’s where we’re at:</p>

<p><em>WHERE:</em> I’ll have a location nailed down by tomorrow afternoon. If all goes well, key elements will be: central (Minneapolis) location, all ages venue, cheap beer, food if you want it, rooftop patio &amp; easy to get to by Metro Transit or bicycle. <strong>Stay tuned…</strong></p>

<p><em>WHEN:</em> How does <strong>Friday, May 1st</strong> work for everyone?</p>

<p>Once we have <em>where</em> and <em>when</em> nailed down, we’ll send off to the gents at Tumblr and get a spiffy <a href="https://staff.tumblr.com/post/68551643/stickers">official Tumblr meetup kit</a> (yup, we’re going all out) and then we’ll put together a flier that everyone can help circulate.</p>

<p>That’s it for now! Gmail us at “twincitiestumblrmeetup” if you have any ideas or questions. Oh! If you know any other Twin City Tumblrs, don’t forget to invite them to <a href="https://twincitiestumblrmeetup.tumblr.com/">follow us</a> for updates.</p></blockquote>
