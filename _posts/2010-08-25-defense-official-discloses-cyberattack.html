<blockquote>
  <p>Deputy Defense Secretary William J. Lynn  III says malicious code placed on the drive by a foreign intelligence agency uploaded itself onto a network run by the U.S. military&rsquo;s Central Command.</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;That code spread undetected on both classified and unclassified systems, establishing what amounted to a digital beachhead, from which data could be transferred to servers under foreign control,&rdquo; he says in the Foreign Affairs article.</p>
  
  <p>Lynn&rsquo;s declassification of the 2008 incident has prompted concern among cyberexperts that he gave adversaries useful information. The Foreign Affairs article, Pentagon officials said, is the first on-the-record disclosure that a foreign intelligence agency had penetrated the U.S. military&rsquo;s classified systems. In 2008, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing anonymous Defense officials, that the incursion might have originated in Russia.</p>

<p>WashPo: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/24/AR2010082406154.html?hpid=topnews">Defense Official Discloses Cyberattack</a> (Thanks, <a href="https://blog.spaf.us/post/1008765503/defense-official-discloses-cyberattack">Spaf</a>.)</p>

<p>First, I still can&rsquo;t stand the term &ldquo;cyber&rdquo;, but this is the DoD, and in government, defense, and intelligence communities, we might as well start calling all technology &ldquo;cybers&rdquo; instead of computers or cellphones or internets.</p>

<p>Second, cyberexpert and cyberattack aren&rsquo;t words.</p>

<p>Third, cyberexperts who are concerned we gave adversaries useful information are beyond ridiculous. Not only because some of those adversaries already know about this, but if you run a normal, non-military/intelligence/national-security system, you know that attacks like these happen every day. There&rsquo;s no reason to believe that they wouldn&rsquo;t happen (albeit with much less frequency) in the military/intelligence/national-security arena.</p>

<p>Fourth, this stuff keeps me up at night. If it takes months for a well-staffed, well-secured IT operation to discover a breach of this nature, I have minimal-to-nil hope of finding these kinds of attacks on my network. But they&rsquo;re there.</p>
