I just upped a few shots from our day in Asakusa, Tokyo, Japan. I&rsquo;ve got lots more to churn through, but this is a short set to test out my workflow. Problems already identified: screwed up tagging/descriptions that didn&rsquo;t stick when I reordered my pictures. Sorry to those reading on RSS readers, that won&rsquo;t happen again. </p>
