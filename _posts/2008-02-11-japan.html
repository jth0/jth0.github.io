<p>We made it. Theresa is off to Karuizawa (actually, she should be there now). I&rsquo;m staying at Jimbocho Sakura Hotel tonight, which is a neat little dorm hotel. I&rsquo;ll have some pics up sometime, if I can find somewhere that will let me plug in USB devices. (Incidentally, that makes it very hard to transfer pictures to my hard drive&hellip;)</p>

<p>Tomorrow I am going to visit Akihabra, a ginormous electronics market place here in Tokyo. I&rsquo;ll stay in a capsule hotel near there tomorrow night, so that should be fun and make for some neat photos.</p>

<p>Wedsnesday I&rsquo;ll head to Kyoto and stay at a very nice looking dorm hotel called <a href="https://www.kyotojp.com/">Kyoto Hostel Tour Club</a>. Not sure what I&rsquo;ll be doing yet in Kyoto, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to it!</p>
