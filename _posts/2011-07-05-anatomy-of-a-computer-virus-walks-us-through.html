<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/25118844?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0"></iframe><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/25118844">Stuxnet: Anatomy of a Computer Virus</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/patrickclair">Patrick Clair</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p><br/><p>&ldquo;Anatomy of a Computer Virus&rdquo; walks us through Stuxnet, the first virus created by a nation-state to attack Iran&rsquo;s nuclear enrichment program. (There could have been others, and this one allegedly was created by several nation-states collaboratively.)</p>

<p>Tin-foil hat stuff aside, this video does a very good job of explaining some of our largest present challenges in information security. If you&rsquo;ve ever asked me what I do, and you weren&rsquo;t satisfied by my &ldquo;Go to meetings to try to stop hackers&rdquo; response, this is the kind of stuff we&rsquo;re trying to protect ourselves against.</p>

<p>While we found later that Stuxnet <em>only</em> targeted enrichment equipment, owned by Iran, used in Iran, this virus (or worm) had infected thousands of computers elsewhere. By infecting systems all over&ndash;including in US power plants and other critical infrastructure, systems that control building heating and ventilation, and so on&ndash;a net was cast wide enough to improve the chances that Iran&rsquo;s enrichment facilities also got infected. This covert activity <em>could</em> have easily been perpetrated by computer criminals instead of the US and EU government consortium. Had that been the case, we could <em>theoretically</em> have had meltdowns in major metropolitan areas across the country. The chances of this are remote, but just one major mishap would still be devastating.</p>

<p>All of this was possible because years ago, people in positions like mine were unable to suss out and explain why building networks the way they did was going to be bad. And so, what I do at work is constantly think and look ahead to avoid similarly bad design ideas, and respond and recover from old bad ideas we didn&rsquo;t stop in time.</p>
