title: "this is why I’m taking Occupy Wall Street — or, perhaps more specifically,
  the ‘We Are The 99 Percent’ movement — seriously. There are a lot of people who
  are getting an unusually raw deal right now. There is a small group of people who
  are getting an unusually good deal right now. That doesn’t sound to me like a stable
  equilibrium. \n\nThe organizers of Occupy Wall Street are fighting to upend the
  system. But what gives their movement the potential for power and potency is the
  masses who just want the system to work the way they were promised it would work.
  It’s not that 99 percent of Americans are really struggling. It’s not that 99 percent
  of Americans want a revolution. It’s that 99 percent of Americans sense that the
  fundamental bargain of our economy — work hard, play by the rules, get ahead — has
  been broken, and they want to see it restored."
