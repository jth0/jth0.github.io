<blockquote><p>Braun T3 transistor radio (1958)</p>
<p>Itâ€™s obvious where Apple got its inspiration.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is well-known that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Ive">Jonathan Ive</a>, the designer behind the iPod, iPad, unibody MacBook, and many other Apple products was heavily influenced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams">Dieter Rams</a>, the chief designer at Braun from &lsquo;61 to '95. For what I&rsquo;ve read and seen in interviews, Rams is flattered and impressed that Apple has not yet effed up Rams&rsquo; ten principles to good design. <a href="https://gizmodo.com/343641/1960s-braun-products-hold-the-secrets-to-apples-future">See also.</a></p>
