<blockquote>
  <p>We start with 100% beef jerky, and SEAR your contact information into it with a 150 WATT CO2 LASER.</p>
  
  <p>Screw die-cutting. Forget about foil, popups, or UV spot lamination. THESE business cards have two ingredients:
  MEAT AND LASERS.</p>
  
  <p>Unlike other business cards, MEAT CARDS will retain value after the econopocalypse. Hoard and barter your calorie-rich, life-sustaining cards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dang, now I want some beef jerky. Anyone willing to barter your hoarded meatcards?</p>
