<p>You&rsquo;re all fired. Thanks for your politically-motivated, partisan efforts to play your personal agenda, but we&rsquo;re not interested. Instead of completing the <strong>one single thing</strong> you&rsquo;re supposed to accomplish &ndash; pass a balanced budget &ndash; you thought a last-minute, five-to-midnight majority vote would do. Total and epic failure by each and every one of you. I will not vote for a single one of you again. Please clear out your desk at your earliest convenience.</p>
