<blockquote>
  <p><a target="c" href="https://www.florentijnhofman.nl/">artist Florentijn Hofman</a> created an actual 100-foot long rubber ducky and sticking it in the water like God’s bathtub.</p>
  
  <p>Why? According to the artist, “The friendly, floating Rubber Duck has healing properties: it can relief mondial tensions as well as define them. The rubber duck is soft, friendly and suitable for all ages!”</p>
