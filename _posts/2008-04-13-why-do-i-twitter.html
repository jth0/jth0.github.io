I&rsquo;ve got a few friends that, once aware of how many different social sites I&rsquo;ve got accounts on, wonder how on Earth I have time to keep that up and why I bother. This goes for Flickr, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google [Talk|Reader|Mail|etc], Tumblr (thank you for reading!) and [especially] Twitter. I&rsquo;ve never come up with a good response, so I thought I&rsquo;d try to take a stab at it here.
</p><p>
I want to start by talking about Twitter, because that seems to be the most bewildering of all these sites. Twitter also should serve as a decent case-study that covers most of these other sites.
</p><p>
I can get a little long-winded, as you&rsquo;ll see. Others have gone on and on about the 140 character limit, but I&rsquo;ll just mention the most import facet [to me] of that constraint: I <b>really</b> have to think about what I&rsquo;m going to say if I have to phrase my message in such a small amount of text. (Clearly, I&rsquo;m not doing that now, but that&rsquo;s why this is a full-on post and not a stream of tweets.) 
</p><p>
I find it a lot easier to stay active with small snippets. I&rsquo;ve never really kept an active blog for more than a week at a time before I lost interest, until I started feeding my Tumblr with Twitter&ndash;automatic content! And that 140-character limit means I have much easier time deciding whether an idea is for Twitter or for Tumblr, in which case I try to organize my thoughts more before putting fingers to keys.
</p><p>
Through Twitter, I&rsquo;ve met or chatted with more interesting and intelligent folks in the past few weeks than I have in the majority of my other online activity. Especially between the <a href="https://mediaphyter.wordpress.com/2008/02/01/security-twits/">Security Twits</a> and the <a href="https://smbmsp.ning.com/">Twin Cities Social Media Breakfast</a> communities, along with randoms I&rsquo;ve found humorous or interesting.
</p><p>
More personally, I have a lot of close friends and family scattered throughout the country in about a dozen states, one in South Korea, and one in Venezuela (soon to be Peru). Online activities are no replacement for face-to-face contact, but it&rsquo;s a connection. If I expand that net to distant friends and acquaintances, I would probably come close to all 50 states and a dozen countries. Now, many of these people don&rsquo;t even know I have a blog and fewer read it regularly, (I can&rsquo;t even get Wifey to read this) but I am going to change that, and I need to make sure they can find something enjoyable when they come here. Which leads to my last reason.
</p><p>
Not everyone knows what I do, not only at work, but also at home. I want to be able to share the things that interest me from every facet of my life; that&rsquo;s the crap that makes us all deeper and more interesting people. And if sharing some of these insights allows you to know me more or sheds light on a previously-unknown common interest, all the better.

Thanks again for reading. </p>
