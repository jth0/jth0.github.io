<blockquote>
  <p>Part art installation, part pacifier, Wee See is a collection of black-and-white animations built from basic shapes to delight both child and parent. As vision develops slowly over the first months of life, Wee See provides surfaces of bold, well-defined artwork to engage your baby’s curious mind and bring the screen to vibrant life.</p>
  
  <p>With great sensitivity to the delicate nature of the audience, Wee See’s animations move methodically slow and maintain an extraordinary simplicity yet remain endlessly inventive.</p>

  <p>I was lucky enough to get my hands on the brand-new two DVD’s and I am <em>impressed</em>. The Wee See videos are a truly artful and minimalist experience. Rolyn and his team did an amazing job. The site, the packaging and the two videos are designed with <em>such</em> attention to detail.</p>
