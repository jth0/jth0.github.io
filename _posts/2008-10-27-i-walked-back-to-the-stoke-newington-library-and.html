<blockquote>I walked back to the Stoke Newington Library and asked for the local history section. They told me that there wasn&rsquo;t one. History had been declared redundant. All that was left were half a dozen pamphlets in a box kept under the desk.</blockquote>&#8212;&ndash;<a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2008/oct/22/hackney-library-book-ban">Iain Sinclair at The Guardian</a>. Unfortunately, not a quote from fiction, but rather Iain&rsquo;s telling his experience, after speaking negatively about the effects of Olympic Park in London for 2012, he was banned from discussing an upcoming&ndash;and unrelated&ndash;book on the local history of Hackney, a borough of London.
