<p>While I find this particular work thought provoking, and I do agree with the general sentiment, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s as simple as &ldquo;big bad corporations did it&rdquo;. Business and Government both have enormous influence over how our population perceives news, media and ideas, but they do not define and dictate. We The People each are ultimately free to make our own decision, and I do believe (hope?) that our government can hold true to their mission of upholding those rights while protecting our safety. Business ultimately pursues their goal of making money; many still pursue that goal with a conscience.</p>

<p>There are always exceptions. Each group loses sight of the fact that each business owner, elected official, employee, and each one&rsquo;s children, must live with their actions. The Black Panthers saw fit to endanger lives. Businesses get greedy (Enron), compromise their integrity (Arthur Anderson), or forget responsibility (AIG, Bear Stearns, Freddie/Fannie, WaMu, etc.). Government forgets their own responsibility, trying to appease the popular vote, compromising the foundation of the government in the name of Security (USA PATRIOT Act), and take advantage of their position accepting bribes and abusing their power of influence.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all shite, but it&rsquo;s still today the best we&rsquo;ve been able to manage. Will it continue endlessly? No, it can&rsquo;t. Especially if government sees fit to bail out irresponsible activities by big business without corresponding action for the citizen. Ignoring bailouts, the growth of the last 15 years could not be sustained endlessly, and we&rsquo;re now catching up. So what next? I don&rsquo;t believe anyone knows that. If they say they do, run away. But I know we&rsquo;ll find out in due time, or our children will. Fun times paired with a much longer post than I anticipated! Happy Tuesday, all.</p>
