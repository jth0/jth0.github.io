<em>11:54</em> I&rsquo;d like something similar to what Danchev posts on his blog: synopses of attacks, hosts used, etc. to ID hosts to null-route at our border. <a href="https://twitter.com/jth/statuses/799660575">#</a>

<em>17:14</em> Just closed on a refi. Painless and actually pleasurable. If you need a referral for an excellent broker in Mpls, please do ask. <a href="https://twitter.com/jth/statuses/799880282">#</a>

<em>22:20</em> A three-fer! House status: refinanced. Coffee pot status: loaded. Consciousness status: sleep. <a href="https://twitter.com/jth/statuses/800061268">#</a>
