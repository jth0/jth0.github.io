<p>I was going to go to this, but can&rsquo;t this weekend. Definitely will in the future. I think it will be fun. <a href="https://www.amandahankerson.com/blog/2009/1/25/paired-part-i.html">Just look at the pictures</a> <a href="https://www.amandahankerson.com/blog/2009/1/26/paired-part-ii.html">of the fun that</a> <a href="https://www.amandahankerson.com/blog/2009/1/27/paired-part-iii.html">other people had a previous event</a>, just like this one. Except you can attend this one, but you can&rsquo;t accept that last one, because it&rsquo;s in the past.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I went to a super cool event at the Casket Arts building. The production combined visual art from Kyle Loven and Andrea Steudel of the Open Eye Theater with a four course dinner, and wine and beer flights, from Chris Olson, the chef who created the menu for Moto-i.</p>
<p>It was aptly called “Paired”, and there’s another one coming up on February 28th; this time the artist is <a href="https://mnartists.org/article.do?rid=65738"><b>Asia Ward</b></a>, who creates pieces that:</p>
<p><img src="https://mnartists.org/uploads/users/user_8052/ffb0322493bfcea4108449519143b614/ffb0322493bfcea4108449519143b614_scale_246_370.jpg" align="left" border="1" vspace="15px" width="154" height="231" hspace="15px" padding="5"/><i>are, without a doubt, initially unsettling; they simultaneously repulse and attract the viewer. If their strange hybridity was their only quality, the repulsion might win out. However, Ward has given them life, of a sort, through the inclusion of motors, music boxes, and springs. They jiggle, shuffle, squeak, and recoil; one of them even cries when the lights go out. Their names, such as “Blind Lion” or “Fraidy Cat,” inspire a kind of pity in the viewer. These are not monsters; they are creatures to be taken care of. They require interaction, maintenance and cuddling. Despite their awkward, unnatural appearances, they are still in need of love and attention.</i></p>
<p>How Olson is going to figure out food to go with that, who knows.</p>
<p>Because space is limited, you have to rsvp in advance, and this upcoming production is $40 per person donation (which you could easily spend on wine alone).  To get more info or buy tickets to the upcoming Paired event, email [pairedmn at gmail dot com].  And if you go, let me know what you thought.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what to think of the little thing in the picture. I don&rsquo;t know if I want to cuddle it, but I don&rsquo;t care. Because there will be good food and good wine in dat joint.</p>
