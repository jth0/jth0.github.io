It turns out they&rsquo;ve been using these since 2005. They&rsquo;re packed full of simply-designed servers (1,160/container) and highly portable due to the container&rsquo;s ease of transport on rail, at sea or over the road. Each server uses a dual-CPU board from Gigabyte (and maybe others) with 8 slots of RAM. There&rsquo;s a good chance that new containers have newer equipment, but that&rsquo;s not clear. Perhaps the most interesting note unveiled yesterday: each server has an on-board 12V battery in case of power loss. Evidently, this choice makes battery backup significantly cheaper than a giant UPS with a slew of batteries.</p>
