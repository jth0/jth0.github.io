<blockquote>But there are some legitimate pronunciation differences, some of which I find very odd. One of them is “greasy”: in BrE that would be [GREE-see], but in AmE it becomes [GREE-zee]<sup>1</sup>. That one still trips me up whenever it comes up, and since some halfwit left a tub of discarded cooking fat in the yard (not the garden!), it comes up with unusual frequency.</blockquote>

<p>That particular one&rsquo;s a pet peave of mine, but it seems to be regional in America. Most people I know use the S, not the Z. But then you have noise/noisy, which would be more accurately spelled noize/noizy in the US. Boise (BOY-zee) mixes it up, but locals from Idaho will hiss that there is no Z in BOY-see. Bah.</p>

<p>The thing I&rsquo;ve found more peculiar is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences#-ise.2C_-ize">-ise/-ize</a>. I tend to prefer the BrE version, but people tend to stare when an American does that. And we wouldn&rsquo;t want that, now would we.</p>
