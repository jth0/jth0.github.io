<img src="/assets/post_files/tumblr_kobrj3AMrm1qz7egyo1_1280.jpg"/><br/><p>This was breakfast. It&rsquo;s a Scandinavian dish called Gravlax. It&rsquo;s traditionally an appetizer composed of a fresh salmon filet cured with sugar, salt and fresh dill for 2-3 days, thinly-slized. Here it&rsquo;s served with hard-boiled egg, onion (alas, I had no red onion this morn), bread and a dijon mayonnaise with capers and sprig of dill. The mayo is not that light, whipped egg-white, flavorless garbage, but real mayonnaise: two egg yolks, some salt, white pepper and lemon juice, creamed and ~1c of oil slowly whipped into emulsification.</p>

<p>Treat yourself.</p>
