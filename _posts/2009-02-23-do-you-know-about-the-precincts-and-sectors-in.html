Do you know anything about recent criminal activity in your sector or precinct? You should, in my opinion, want to keep abreast of that information, and the Minneapolis Police Department makes that fairly easy for you to do. Visit the <a href="https://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/police/crimealert/signup.asp">MPD Email Alert Signup</a> page today to keep up on the activity that affects you and your neighbors. And share this information with other neighbors, too.</p>

<p>Notch this service up as a point to Minneapolis in the MPLS vs. STP war; Saint Paul&rsquo;s police department is completely devoid of any information, on this or any other topic.</p>
