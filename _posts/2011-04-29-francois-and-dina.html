<p>Sometimes, the Internet is awesome. I logged into Tumblr this morning to find a &ldquo;message&rdquo; (something I hadn&rsquo;t received before on Tumblr) to find the following note:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi John,</p>
  
  <p>I would like to express thanks and appreciation to you because, I hope, you will allow me to discover Dina, my mum and her family that is also mine. I have attempted to find them in vain for the past fifty years</p>
  
  <p>Dina and her family (Hans, her husband and children: Eric, ***, ***&hellip;) welcomed me as their son in their home in Tomales when they were managing a dairy farm in Tomales. My name is Francois (Fara) ****, from Senegal, West Africa. I was a student at the University of California in the early 70&rsquo;s where I studied with Eric who was my roommate. The ****es are wonderful people. They opened their home to me and accepted me as their son and brother without any prejudice at all. I owe them a lot.</p>
  
  <p>I would appreciate all the assistance you could give me to touch base with them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I started reading, I thought: &ldquo;Damn, only spam.&rdquo; Then recognized two words: Dina, and ****es (which is not actually four asterisks followed by the letters Eee and Ess, but the last name of Dina, a person). My wife and I met Dina while traveling through California several years ago, and I presume Francois found a picture of Dina, my wife, and I, and subsequently found one of the many, many ways to contact me online.</p>

<p>I happily forwarded this note to Dina, and another to Francois. It feels very good to be able to make a connection like this!</p>
