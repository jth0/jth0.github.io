<em>07:00</em> Up early. Cat things tended to, guest-dog fed, now getting ready for a 20-mile bike to the MPLS farmer&rsquo;s market. Later: my cousin&rsquo;s wedding. <a href="https://twitter.com/jth/statuses/829051320">#</a>

<em>10:41</em> Had a great ride to the market and back. Sitting on the porch listening to music and the birds. It&rsquo;s a fucking good morning. <a href="https://twitter.com/jth/statuses/829166878">#</a>
