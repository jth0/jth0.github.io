<blockquote><p>You know what’s awesome? Having to click “Always Allow” 231 times just to sync my frigging phone. And if you think “Always Allow” actually means <em>always</em> allow, not just allow until next time it needs to look, boy, you must not be a 1Password user.</p></blockquote>

<p>Switch to Agile format. Then use Dropbox to keep that synced among multiple macs. Way better than keychain format, and way <em>way <strong>way</strong></em> better than using MobileMe to keep that keychain sync&rsquo;d (a sure-fire way to a corrupt keychain).</p>
