<p>I&rsquo;ve just revised the way my site here is set up. We&rsquo;ll see how this goes.</p>

<p>I just hacked in comments to my Tumblr account using <a href="https://disqus.com/people/jth/">Disqus</a>! I&rsquo;ve also stopped pulling my <a href="https://twitter.com/jth">Twitter</a> RSS feed directly to Tumblr. I&rsquo;m now using <a href="https://www.loudtwitter.com/">LoudTwitter</a> to post my Twits for each day to my <a href="https://minntc.livejournal.com">LiveJournal</a>. Tumblr (this site) will then pull the RSS feed of my LiveJournal blog, which will include those Tweets. I&rsquo;m still including my <a href="https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?id=55645851@N00&amp;lang=en-us&amp;format=rss_200">Flickr feed</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/16380549340413042933/state/com.google/broadcast">Google Reader feed</a> here.</p>

<p>Hopefully this lets my tumblog here become a good central point for all my activity without overloading those of you using RSS to follow me! So if you have any thoughts or comments, feel free to leave them, since you can now!</p>
