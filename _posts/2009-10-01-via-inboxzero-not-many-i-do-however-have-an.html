<p>Not many. I do, however, have an entire department, replicated 32 times across the enterprise for whom I work, that believe that if they run a report, and that data is not exact as of that <em>second</em>, it is not informative, accurate, or useful. We&rsquo;re talking about reports showing grade/class performance across a student population of around 350,000 across the system. Reader, meet the institutional research department.</p>

<p>Oh, then there&rsquo;s the <em>other</em> department, replicated 32 times across the enterprise, who <em>also</em> need up to the second reporting, but this time their numbers are thousands to millions. Reader, meet the Finance department.</p>

<p>Lets not even talk about the two-year old, still not quite grok-able Action Analytics project, which will measure the bejeezus out of whatever the project measures. But don&rsquo;t ask what they&rsquo;ll measure. Unless &ldquo;measuring student success&rdquo; means something to you. And don&rsquo;t ask them <em>why</em> they&rsquo;re measuring what they&rsquo;re going to measure. Unless &ldquo;improving student success&rdquo; means something. This one has hope &ndash; they&rsquo;ll get there eventually, but the cart is about a quarter-mile ahead of the horse who&rsquo;s still trying to wake up for the day.</p>
