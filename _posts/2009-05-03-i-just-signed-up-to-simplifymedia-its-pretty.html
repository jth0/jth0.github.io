It lets you stream your library to your other computers and to your friends. It works with or without iTunes. You can have 30 friends, I guess. I don&rsquo;t yet have that many, which you can see above. I&rsquo;m &lsquo;joth&rsquo; because some ass took 'jth&rsquo; already. Ass.</p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="https://tr.im/klCS">head here</a> to download and install, then add me, especially if you have lots of good musics.</p>

<p>P.S. You should start by listening to &ldquo;My Mix&rdquo;. I made it for a few friends last year, and I think it&rsquo;s pretty good. The other mixes listed are from friends, and they are also very good.</p>
