<blockquote>The graph above in Figure 3 illustrates the myth that you can cut taxes and increase spending and expect to get increased government revenue.  Interestingly, since Johnson, every Democrat has increased revenue more than spending.  However in the opposite case, under all five Republican Presidents, since Nixon, government revenue has decreased and spending has increased.  This is positive, unambiguous proof that cutting taxes does not increase revenue.  Yet John McCain is still trying to sell that old canard.</blockquote>
