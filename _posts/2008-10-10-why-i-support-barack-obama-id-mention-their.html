<p>I&rsquo;d mention their respective economic plans, but neither is too different and both are changing daily as the market continues to fall. (As I write this, the DJIA is down another 600 points, sitting around 8,000.)</p>

<p>Everything I&rsquo;ve seen leads me to believe Obama is more fiscally-conservative than McCain, which matters to me. But let&rsquo;s be clear here, neither candidate can call themselves fiscally conservative, just so we get that out of the way. Moreover, the tax-breaks that come in with O&rsquo;s fiscal conservatism will actually affect me. Not the case with McCain&rsquo;s tax plan.</p>

<p>McCain&rsquo;s voting record shows <a href="https://www.veteransforcommonsense.org/?Page=Article&amp;ID=9559">he will <strong>not</strong> vote to provide stronger benefits to our soldiers and veterans</a>; Obama has, which means my brother will get better college education when he retires from the Army. This also matters to me.</p>

<p>O is pro-choice, M is anti-abortion. This matters to me.</p>

<p>M&rsquo;s health-care plan spends nearly as much as O&rsquo;s, but O&rsquo;s plan <a href="https://www.epi.org/content.cfm/pm126">does a better job</a> covering the uninsured, especially over time.</p>

<p>I think welfare is an important component to enabling unemployed to find gainful employment. This one is easy: O and M are pretty much identical in their stance on social welfare programs.</p>

<p>O&rsquo;s foreign policy isn&rsquo;t trying to build up more enemies. M sees &ldquo;KGB&rdquo; in the eyes of one of the largest democracies in the world. Both take an aggressive stance, but I think O will do a better job globally at improving our reputation after the damage done by W&rsquo;s wanton expression of authority.</p>

<p>Neither O or M support marriage for gay and lesbian couples. This is discrimination, nothing more, nothing less. The offering up of &ldquo;civil unions&rdquo; is a weak start, but when I complete my W-4 every year, I&rsquo;m marking &ldquo;M&rdquo; for married, not &ldquo;civilly unioned&rdquo;. Marriage is already a &ldquo;civil union&rdquo; and has been for a long time. If a couple is wed in a church without a <strong>marriage</strong> license, they are not married legally. For those that wish it, let churches co-opt the term &ldquo;civil union&rdquo; if they feel the need to differentiate. <em>If the church and religious folk want to preserve the &ldquo;sanctity&rdquo; of marriage, outlaw divorce first.</em></p>

<p>Last for me: Obama supports net-neutrality, M <a href="https://archive.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2007/6/3/224720.shtml">does not</a>. What this means: in the future, your internet service provider will charge you by the bit for service, and will charge you at different rates based on who&rsquo;s offering the service. So one theoretical situation in the future: Comcast sets up a deal so Yahoo! is free, but Google costs you $1/Gigabyte. To non-techies: there is no rhyme, no reason and no asset to back up charging for differentiated service like this. It is <em>not</em> the same as electricity, water, or gas in that sense.</p>
