Mike Janke over at <a href="https://lastinfirstout.blogspot.com/">Last In - First Out</a> wrote a post on <a href="https://lastinfirstout.blogspot.com/2009/11/cargo-cult-system-administration.html">Cargo Cult System Administration</a>, or the practice of taking action without understanding why in hope that things will get better.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Following a security recipe without understanding the risks you are addressing.  If you don&rsquo;t understand how hackers infiltrate your systems and ex-filtrate your data, then your DLP, Firewalls, IDS, SEIM, etc. are cargo cult.
