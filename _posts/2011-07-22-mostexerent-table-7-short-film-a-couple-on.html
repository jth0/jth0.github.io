<p>Lovely film. If you&rsquo;d like an experience like this, visit Chino Latino in Uptown Minneapolis. The fortune cookies, near as I can tell, are written and delivered by your server. I&rsquo;ve received one that said &ldquo;Your forehead is shiny.&rdquo; (And it was&ndash;the server could have saved me two years of a painfully bad haircut by saying &ldquo;You&rsquo;d look better with a buzzed cut.&rdquo;) Another person who never ironed his clothes received &ldquo;What&rsquo;s with your shirt, haven&rsquo;t you heard of an iron?&rdquo;</p>
