  This final fight scene is absolute magic. I don’t know about you but when Ninja Turtles and mutants bust through the club and start fighting, I too would panic for a hot minute…then naturally get back on stage and just happen to rap along with the scene with fitting lyrics and everyone’s back to dancing again.

  The coup de grâce however, comes when Shredder shows up and thanks to an Ernie Reyes, Jr. roundhouse kick, finds himself in front of the speakers. Donatello, in brilliant fashion, cranks the volume up to 11 and signals to Michaelangelo. Mikey then whips out a keytar, plays a sweet lick, and blows up the speakers. This causes Shredder to be projectiled way the fuck in the air, across the club, and through the wall in such a hilarious manner that only Rick Moranis in Spaceballs could possibly top.
