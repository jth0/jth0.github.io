<blockquote>I have made the jump to Mac and OS X &hellip; I was wondering what anyone would suggest for resources or books to get under the hood of OS X.</blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve fielded this question several times in the past few weeks and figured I&rsquo;d post my response here for posterity and reference.<br/><br/>Apple&rsquo;s training is a really good resource, and even if some of your mentors suck, it&rsquo;s $99. For one course a week. For a year. And that&rsquo;s actually $79 if you are still in school (or at least still have your student id ;) Oh, and that training is good for Apple&rsquo;s pro apps like Aperture, too.<br/><br/>My &ldquo;short&rdquo; list of third-party apps to check out:<br/><br/>Quicksilver rocks. Adium is much nicer [IMO] than iChat. Aperture 2 rocks. Firefox 3 beta is more stable and faster than FF2 on mac. Office 2008 is more stable and about as fast as 2004. If you&rsquo;re a twitterer, twitterific is nice. If you don&rsquo;t have a decent external hard drive, use the Disk Utility (inside Applications/Utilities) to resize your primary partition and leave yourself 75-100GB for a second partition to use with Time Machine backups. SuperDuper! is great for taking a bootable backup. [These go for all users, regardless of Mac, Win or Linux.] Use Mozy, iBackup, or some similar over-the-wire for off-site backup.<br/><br/>Hard disk errors still happen. Apple&rsquo;s disk utilities is more or less fsck with a few more capabilities. But it&rsquo;s not rock-solid. If/when you have hdd issues, DiskWarrior will probably fix it. Worth having on-hand for preventative maintenance.<br/><br/></p>
