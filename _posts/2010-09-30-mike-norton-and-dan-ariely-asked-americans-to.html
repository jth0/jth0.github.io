  <p>[Mike Norton and Dan Ariely] asked Americans to first guess at the distribution of wealth in the United States, and then we asked them to lay out what they think would be the ideal distribution of wealth if they were to enter society and be placed randomly in a class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This image is a bit tough to understand at first glance, but here&rsquo;s your hint: the first bar graph shows the upper quintile (upper-fifth of America) owns ~84% of the wealth in this country. The next seven bars are various peoples&rsquo; estimate at the wealth distribution in America. The last seven bars are various peoples&rsquo; definition of an ideal wealth distribution given the scenario above.</p>

<p>The first bar versus the first seven estimates are the eye-opener.</p>
