title: I couldn’t help noticing a few things about this transaction. First, something
  about Twitter creates trust and togetherness; some of my actors drove over an hour
  to a place they’d never been, responding to a 140-character request from a person
  they’d never met. No other technology, online or off, would have resolved my quest
  so satisfactorily.
