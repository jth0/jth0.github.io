We&rsquo;re both thrilled to be playing so well. It&rsquo;s a little surprising to enter a national competition with little knowledge of the teams you&rsquo;re playing, or their ability levels, and hold your own. My only regret at this point was getting on the ice with Jamie and Nate Haskell, the defending champions, and expecting a big loss. Mind you, that outcome would not have surprised me one bit, but to start the game and <em>expect</em> it&hellip; Jamie and Nate are no slouches, but the mixed doubles format is a bit of a crap-shoot, and anyone has a chance at a win here. I guess I&rsquo;ll have to adjust that attitude for next year!</p>
