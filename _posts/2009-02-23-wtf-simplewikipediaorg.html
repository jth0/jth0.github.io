<p>I enjoyed this snippet of the article <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper">Sniper</a> on simple.wikipedia.org:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A sniper is a soldier in an army who has special training with sniper rifles. Snipers are able to shoot at targets very far away, or that are very small, and hit them accurately using a sniper scope. They are also specially trained to be stealthy and hard for the enemy to see when they are hiding, by using camouflage.</p>
  
  <p>Many police departments have snipers on their SWAT team. Often hunters can learn many of the skills that snipers need to know, because the two jobs are very similar, and sniping developed from hunting &ldquo;snipe&rdquo;, birds that were very hard to see and shoot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Simple</a> is described as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wikipedias are places where people work together to write encyclopedias in different languages. We only use simple English words and grammar here. The Simple English Wikipedia is for everyone! That includes children and adults who are learning English.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So while the idea behind this is great, I&rsquo;m guessing there&rsquo;s quite a bit of humorous fodder. <a href="https://xkcd.com/547/">Thank you, XKCD.</a></p>
