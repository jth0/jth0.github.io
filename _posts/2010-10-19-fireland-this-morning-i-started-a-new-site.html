<blockquote><p>This morning I started a new site called <a href="https://www.chokeville.com/">Chokeville</a>. Someone just asked me to summarize it <i>succinctly</i> (like, let’s keep this short, weisenheimer, can’t be jawing about blogs all day when there’s tail to nail) and I said well, man, I guess it’s ten thousand little stories about a made-up city and — but he was already gone.</p>

<p>The first six stories are up now. I have an idea for a bunch more but that’ll get us to maybe thirty. Not sure about the other 9,970. Surely I’ll have a team handling the work for me by then, like whoever does Garfield.</p>

<p>Anyway this first batch provides an introduction to some of the characters we’ll be dealing with. I didn’t do this on purpose but I think every story features at least one person getting punched or stabbed.</p>

<p>Moving forward, I’ll be fleshing out the site (which I built yesterday out of 1997 HTML!) with maps, photos, illustrations, movies, podcasts, and whatevers, but this is the jumping off point. I hope you’ll jump off with me.</p>

<p>P.S. The above logo is by god damn <a href="https://jasonpermenter.com/">Jason Permenter</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is quite honestly awesome. Go start reading, because the little bits of this story that are up are fantastic, and I&rsquo;m eager for more. Go. Now. Read. And share this with others!</p>
