<p>The multi-layered mixes Kieran Hebden assembles for this four minute track welcome you into this, Four Tet&rsquo;s fifth album. Annie Lennox&rsquo;s choppy chanting of &ldquo;there is love in you&rdquo; floats throughout the track, providing a digitized glue for the track. The vocals also lay a strong organic foundation to balance out the beeps and blips that get tiresome when overused in electronica, accentuated by the fact that her loop seems to be cut so it is never quite the same, even though it is. &ldquo;Angel Echoes&rdquo; presents a lovely tempo to lead into the rest of this great album.</p>
