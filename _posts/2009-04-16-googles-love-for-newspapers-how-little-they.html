<a href="https://daggle.com/090406-225638.html">Google's Love For Newspapers & How Little They Appreciate It</a><br/><p>Danny Sullivan over on Daggle.com writes a good, long post on the old media dogs&rsquo; whining and bitching about those evil search engines and all the unwanted traffic they bring.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I&rsquo;m going to save you all those potential legal fees plus needing to even speak further about the evil of the Big G with two simple lines. Get your tech person to change your robots.txt file to say this:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p><code>User-agent: *</code>
    <br/>
    <code>Disallow: /</code></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Done. Do that, you&rsquo;re outta Google. All your pages will be removed, and you needn&rsquo;t worry about Google listing the Wall St. Journal at all.</p>
  
  <p>Oh, but you won&rsquo;t do that. You want the traffic, but you also want to be like the AP and hope you can scare Google into paying you. Maybe that will work. Or maybe you&rsquo;ll be like all those Belgian papers that tried the same thing and watched their traffic sadly dry up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, that would be very sad, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>
