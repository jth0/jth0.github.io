<img src="/assets/post_files/tumblr_l85fvmXTnY1qzswbwo1_1280.jpg"/><br/><p>This is still pretty much what my job is like today in the mushrooming electronics (now called computing or information technology) industry. Wearing a dapper suit in an enormous empty space, staring at one of four large cabinets, thinking to myself, &ldquo;What are these big, round things anyway? What happens if I turn it just a touch?&rdquo;</p>
