<p>I am joining a bocce ball league for the summer. Its basically going to look a lot like this.</p>
<p>Except PBRs instead of wine. And no one is allowed to wear khakis or chinos.<br/>And we’re not douches.</p>

<p> I LOVE BOCCE BALL!… and pbr… and douches… o wait.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sure, but is being a hipster vs. a yuppie really that much better? Isn&rsquo;t a hipster just a trashier-looking (though no less-expensively) dressed yuppie?</p>

<p>Either way, I think we can all agree that bocce rocks. Who doesn&rsquo;t like tossing balls around the lawn?</p>
