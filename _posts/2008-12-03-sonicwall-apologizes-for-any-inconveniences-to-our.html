<blockquote>SonicWALL apologizes for any inconveniences to our customers caused by this issue. SonicWALL is thoroughly reviewing the root cause of issue and will take corrective actions to avoid any problems of this nature from reoccurring.</blockquote>&#8212;<p>SonicWALL&rsquo;s apology for their <a href="https://www.sonicwall.com/us/11087.html">shit getting fucked</a>. I seriously hope no customers of SonicWALL were compromised due to their devices&rsquo; failing <strong>open</strong> yesterday. In the world of big-ess-Security, this is a seriously Bad Thing.</p>

<p>Why in the world would <em>anyone</em> think this model makes sense:<br/>
1. You buy our box and rely on it for the protection of your network.<br/>
2. You pay us exorbitant, annual &ldquo;licensing&rdquo; fees for the right to use the box you just bought.<br/>
3. If you don&rsquo;t pay, or if our shit gets fucked, your shit also gets fucked when your security devices open the gates.</p>
