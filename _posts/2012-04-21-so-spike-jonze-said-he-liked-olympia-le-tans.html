She capitulated on the condition that Spike make her a film. And so we are left with &ldquo;Mourir Auprès de Toi&rdquo; which is an adorable stop-motion film considering what may happen in a cozy book shop after dark. It&rsquo;s title translates to &ldquo;To Die By Your Side&rdquo;. J'adore ça.</p>
