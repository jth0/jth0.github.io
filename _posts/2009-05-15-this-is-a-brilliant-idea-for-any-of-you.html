<img src="/assets/post_files/TxUk6mAtEnii4ot2a3fGAl8Eo1_500.jpg"/><br/><p>This is a brilliant idea for any of you photographers who&rsquo;ve been hassled by rent-a-cops (or more frighteningly, real police officers) for photography&ndash;which is not a crime. I would definitely change this from &ldquo;US Department of Homeland Security&rdquo; to &ldquo;Department of Public Affairs&rdquo; or something. I would also replace the DHS logo with a generic Eagle &amp; Shield seal with my fake department&rsquo;s name around the ring.</p>

<p>Also, I would only <em>ever</em> use this with security guards and rent-a-cops when I am legally in-the-right to use my camera. <a href="https://www.krages.com/lhp.htm">This document</a> will guide you as to your complete legal rights as a citizen looking to make some photographs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the event you&rsquo;re stopped by overzealous law enforcement or security officials attempting to enforce fictitious laws, I&rsquo;ve designed these fictitious and official-looking Photographer&rsquo;s Licenses. If you have Adobe Illustrator, you can download the EPS vector art file and print your own. You&rsquo;ll need a photo of yourself, and OCR (or a similar font) to fill in your personal information.</p>
