<p>Ron Paul thinks the sick and uninsured should assume responsibility for themselves. This is exactly what he let his campaign chairman&rsquo;s family do with a $400 thousand dollar debt in 2008, after he died of pneumonia, unable to receive treatment in time because he didn&rsquo;t have insurance. After he raised over $19 million dollars for Ron Paul&rsquo;s campaign. &ldquo;Let him die,&rdquo; indeed. This perhaps reaffirms the idea that right-wingers/ultra-conservatives will only take action to try and save a life until a baby is born. <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/09/17/1017278/-Letting-them-die">The Daily Kos</a> goes into more detail, better than I can. And now I&rsquo;m going to go be sick for a bit. I kinda figured a doctor would have taken the hippocratic oath more seriously, and in all parts of his or her life. Evidently the Tea Party prefers a hypocritical oath.</p>
