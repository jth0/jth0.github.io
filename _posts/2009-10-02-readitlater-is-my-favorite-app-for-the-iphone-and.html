RIL integrates with Google Reader and Firefox so all you have to do is click a button to add an article to your reading list for later. At any point, you can pull up an item from that list, mark it as read once you&rsquo;ve finished, or stop reading and resume later where you left off. And because your reading list gets synced, you can do all this from the browser plugin, the RIL website, your iPhone, or another computer.</p>

<p>It supports other browsers as well, but the integration isn&rsquo;t close to what you get from the RIL Firefox extension. The free version will hook you and the pro version is worth every 299 pennies.</p>
