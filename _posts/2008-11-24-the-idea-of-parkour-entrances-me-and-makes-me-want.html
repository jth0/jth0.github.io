The reality of Parkour is that I would most likely fall on my head the second time I tried to flip, breaking my neck and paralyzing me for life. So I will enjoy this trailer for <strong><a href="https://www.blog.kasparworks.com/blog.kasparworks.com/Optegnelser/2008/11/14_%C2%B7_MY_PLAYGROUND_%C2%B7_TEASER_1.html">My Playground</a></strong>, an upcoming documentary about movement in urban spaces, and presumably, Parkour. {<a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/CoudalFreshSignals/~3/461880581/trailer_for_my.php">coudal</a>}</p>
