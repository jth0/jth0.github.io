<p>I have a few friends with LJ blogs. I tried to keep one updated myself. That didn&rsquo;t work so well, either because I didn&rsquo;t know what to write, or didn&rsquo;t think to share something funny, etc. I&rsquo;m thinking tumblr&rsquo;s format might allow me to post a little more. And if nothing else, I can use it to aggregate feeds of other sites where some content actually generated by me can be found. </p><p>If I did new year&rsquo;s resolutions, I might make one stating &ldquo;I will keep updating my tumblr web-corner.&rdquo; But I don&rsquo;t do resolutions, and I probably will have to try hard to keep updating this site. Actually, I do one resolution, but it&rsquo;s the same each year: make it through another year. Conveniently, new year&rsquo;s resolutions for me are also birthday resolutions.</p><p>Happy John&rsquo;s Birthday Eve!</p>
