title: I consider the “Tea Party Movement” to be one of the most brilliant sociological
  ploys. Perhaps unmatched since a million poor white southern farmers were talked
  into eagerly and courageously fighting to the death, in order to protect the feudal
  privileges of a tiny, slave-holding aristocracy. Yes, it is that impressive. Get
  them to think they are fighting for one thing, while dying for something else. Likewise,
  by holding up and waving an obsolete and irrelevant old “left-right political-axis,”
  today’s feudal lords have managed to stir Red America into a frenzy of unparalleled
  rancor toward every single group or profession that has both knowledge and professional
  skill — from scientists to teachers, civil servants, academics, medical doctors,
  attorneys, diplomats, skilled labor… amounting to a “war on smartypants.”
