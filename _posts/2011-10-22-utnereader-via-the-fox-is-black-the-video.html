<p>The video above was shot completely with an iPhone 4S, and the quality  is stunning. I wonder how many people would have guessed it was shot on  an iPhone if they didn’t have previous knowledge?</p>
<p>The video was made by <a href="https://beanpole.com.au/">Benjamin Dowie</a>,  who did a wonderful job of capturing a day at the beach, but couldn’t  anyone do the same with an iPhone and a bit of knowledge of filmmaking?  That’s kind of the magic with this update is that we all have the  potential to make beautiful things. The iPhone is good at cashing in on  this, democratizing tools and allowing most people to create amazing  things, like what Instragram does with photography.</p>

<p>The video is amazing on these phones. Now I just need to learn to shoot and edit video.</p>
