All are non-sequiters at the end of Sarah Palin&rsquo;s bio on the <a href="https://www.gov.state.ak.us/bio.html">Governor of Alaska&rsquo;s website</a>. Palin is so amazingly unqualified it boggles the mind. If the democratic party can&rsquo;t eek a win out against a McCain/Palin ticket, it should be water-boarded.
