The link above also includes an MP3 of this talk and a copy of the slides that didn&rsquo;t work for Merlin&rsquo;s presentation at Rutgers.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty excited for Merlin&rsquo;s upcoming book <a href="https://inboxzero.com/">Inbox Zero</a>, a book that will riff off of and build on <a href="https://inboxzero.com/video/">Merlin&rsquo;s original &ldquo;Inbox Zero&rdquo; talk at Google in 2007</a>,</p>
