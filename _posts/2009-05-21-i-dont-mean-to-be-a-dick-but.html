<p><b><a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://inthefade.tumblr.com/post/109031823/i-dont-mean-to-be-a-dick-but">inthefade</a></b>: I hate, hate, hate when photographs are reblogged without attribution. I don’t mean those funny, photoshopped images that have been passed around the internet 700 times. I mean photographs. Someone’s art. &hellip; That’s like quoting someone but not giving credit for the quote. It’s lazy.</p>

<p>Agreed. I try to replicate all links in photo posts I reblog, showing a chain of attribution going back in time. Result looks like this: (via x : y : z). If this post where a photo, it’d be (via <a href="https://ronbailey.tumblr.com/post/109046245/i-dont-mean-to-be-a-dick-but">ronbailey</a> : <a href="https://inthefade.tumblr.com/post/109031823/i-dont-mean-to-be-a-dick-but">inthefade</a>) for example.</p></blockquote>

<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t give a rip who blogged it or where I found it. There&rsquo;s plenty of stuff I come across five times in a day, and it&rsquo;s annoying at best to credit them all. And who cares who found it first, it wasn&rsquo;t me and it probably wasn&rsquo;t the collective you.</p>

<p>What I want to see and what I strive to include, like Eunice, is the original photographer. That matters much more, and if someone likes the images I&rsquo;ve found, I hope that person hits up that photographer and buys a print. I try to do that when I&rsquo;m so inspired and I have the funds. All my links will point back to the original, as well.</p>
