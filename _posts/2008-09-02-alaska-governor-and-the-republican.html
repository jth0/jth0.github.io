Palin has four years under her belt as Governor. The rest of her experience? Right here in beautiful Wasilla, home to 5,500; two terms on the city council and two terms as city manager/mayor. Which makes eight years. Which means two-thirds of Palin&rsquo;s experience is based in this town.</p>

<p>I know several Republican women that are more qualified and have never run for any office before. If I were a Republican and Palin was the most-qualified woman the Republican Party would bring forward and put on a ballot, I&rsquo;d be pissed. It&rsquo;s a good thing I&rsquo;m not a Republican.</p>
