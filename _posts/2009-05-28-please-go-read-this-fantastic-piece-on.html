<blockquote>
  <p>Photographer Richard Mosse &hellip; returned from a trip to Iraq &hellip; with an unexpectedly intense, and hugely impressive, new body of work.</p>
  
  <p>These images &hellip; show the imperial palaces of Saddam Hussein converted into temporary housing for the U.S military. Vast, self-indulgent halls of columned marble and extravagant chandeliers, surrounded by pools, walls, moats, and, beyond that, empty desert, suddenly look more like college dormitories. Weight sets, flags, partition walls, sofas, basketball hoops, and even posters of bikini&rsquo;d women have been imported to fill Saddam&rsquo;s spatial residuum. The effect is oddly decorative, as if someone has simply moved in for a long weekend, unpacking an assortment of mundane possessions.
  The effect is like an ironic form of camouflage, making the perilously foreign seem all the more familiar and habitableâ€”a kind of military twist on postmodern interior design.</p>
