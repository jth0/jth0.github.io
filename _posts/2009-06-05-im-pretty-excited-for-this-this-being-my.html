<img src="/assets/post_files/TxUk6mAtEocpebx4IlZHvqfVo1_400.png"/><br/><p>I&rsquo;m pretty excited for this. (<em>This</em> being my read-along of <em>Infinite Jest</em> with the internets.) I&rsquo;m doing this on a total whim, not knowing much about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace">DFW </a>aside from my glance at the all-knowing W. I ordered (and received) my copy from a used bookseller via Amazon. As a result of following this, I&rsquo;ve already been enlightened. There&rsquo;s a Twincy group called <a href="https://booksandbars.com/">Books &amp; Bars</a>! This made my day, doubly so since my Tuesday is free. I think I&rsquo;ll be stopping by the <a href="https://bryantlakebowl.com/">BLB</a> Tuesday evening, even though I haven&rsquo;t read their <a href="https://www.magersandquinn.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=1964233&amp;isbn_id=4599649">current book</a>.</p>
