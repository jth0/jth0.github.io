<p>This is kinda what I was hoping wouldn&rsquo;t happen after electing Obama. We haven&rsquo;t solved anything yet, and telling people that everything is fixed is damaging and misleading. Lots of campaign glad-handing. He does eventually say we haven&rsquo;t done anything yet, but passing the bill wasn&rsquo;t the hard part. Doing something with that money is the hard part.</p>

<p>And what&rsquo;s with that preview frame. Can&rsquo;t we get our president some glassware so he doesn&rsquo;t have to buy water? Is the municipal water in D.C. that bad?</p>
