I don&rsquo;t think this is &ldquo;not a crime&rdquo; as some claim, but I also believe that charging more than $1/track is insane. And he supported <a href="https://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2009/01/obama-sides-wit.html">granting immunity</a> to <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/nsa-spying">telecom companies for illegally wiretapping US citizens</a>. Both issues were also supported by the Bush/Cheney administrations and by McCain/Palin.</p>
