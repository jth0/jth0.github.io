<em>19:16</em> Just read a play-by-play of Mediate and Woods&rsquo; round today. I wish I could have watched that round today! What a finish it must have been! <a href="https://twitter.com/jth/statuses/836419008">#</a>

<em>21:52</em> Removing the ignition cylinder from my motysickle. This is akin to open-heart surgery to repair a hangnail. <a href="https://twitter.com/jth/statuses/836509107">#</a>
