title: Americans are and have always been credulous skeptics. They question the authority
  of priests, then talk to the dead; they second-guess their cardiologists, then seek
  out quacks in the jungle. Like people in every society, they do this in moments
  of crisis when things seem hopeless. They also, unlike people in other societies,
  do it on the general principle that expertise and authority are inherently suspect.
