  Interviewed at their home last week, Gene and Helene speculated about what it would mean if a black man were actually elected president.

  “Just imagine,” she said.

  “It’d be really something,” he said.

  …

  They talked about praying to help Barack Obama get to the White House. They’d go vote together. She’d lean on her cane with one hand, and on him with the other, while walking down to the precinct. And she’d get supper going afterward. They’d gone over their Election Day plans more than once.

  “Imagine,” she said.

  “That’s right,” he said.

  On Monday Helene had a doctor’s appointment. Gene woke and nudged her once, then again. He shuffled around to her side of the bed. He nudged Helene again. He was all alone.

  …

  The butler cast his vote for Obama on Tuesday. He so missed telling his Helene about the black man bound for the Oval Office.
