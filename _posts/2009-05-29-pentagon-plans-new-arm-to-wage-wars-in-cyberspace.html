<blockquote>
  <p>The Pentagon plans to create a new military command for cyberspace, administration officials said Thursday, stepping up preparations by the armed forces to conduct both offensive and defensive computer warfare.</p>
  
  <p>The military command would complement a civilian effort to be announced by President Obama on Friday that would overhaul the way the United States safeguards its computer networks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This could be very interesting. It could also be a high-level announcement of something we&rsquo;ll never hear of again. I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;ll be neither. But I do hope that this first step and each step that follows are all done legally. Our last President didn&rsquo;t seem to be aware of the confines of our bill of rights and our constitution.</p>

<p>But seriously, as long as there isn&rsquo;t some loopy general in the Pentagon screaming that we need an <em>American Anti-terrorist National Patriotic Great Firewall of These United States of America</em> bigger than China&rsquo;s, this is a Good Thing™ and has been a Long Time Coming™. A huge part of the new workload of the cybersecurity office in the White House and the cybersecurity command in the Pentagon will focus on securing our current infrastructure. &ldquo;<em>[The office] will coordinate a multibillion-dollar effort to restrict access to government computers and protect systems that run the stock exchanges, clear global banking transactions and manage the air traffic control system.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>This hits a lot of technology in a lot of industries, and if this is done well, everyone else stands to benefit from the trickle-down. I&rsquo;m hopeful. Secure computing is attainable, but it&rsquo;ll take a new approach and a ton of hard work to get there.</p>
