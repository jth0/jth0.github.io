He was self-taught and became known as American Primitivism. (Thanks, Wikipedia!) I don&rsquo;t know what that means, but it sounds impressive. I do know that I like it. He was a drinker, diabetic, chronically poverty-stricken until he had a resurgence in the `90&rsquo;s after he discovered he still had an audience. (Thanks again, Wikipedia!) He made a few more records, but after years of hard living taking their toll, he died after going under the knife for a sextuple bypass.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of sadness, too common in truly gifted musicians. But after all that, listen to the beautiful music he sacrificed his dignity and his life for. Have a really fucking good Thursday. Make it count.</p>
