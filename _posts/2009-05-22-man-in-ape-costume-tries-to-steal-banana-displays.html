<p>HAAHAHAHAAHAhahaha&hellip;whoo!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Capt. Steve Klein says Thursday someone donning an ape costume entered two gas stations Wednesday trying to steal the displays and police have received several calls about the suspect hanging around town.</p>

<p>What else would an ape do, aside from hang around. Have you ever seen an ape in a human suit? They immediately become violent. It&rsquo;s pretty neat, actually.</p>

<p>See?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While Klein acknowledges that the action may seem funny, they want to talk to the person behind the ape suit because they aren&rsquo;t sure what the suspect&rsquo;s motives are.</p>

<p>My guess: he&rsquo;s hungry!</p>
