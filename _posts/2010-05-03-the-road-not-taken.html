<p>Robert Frost, 1916.</p>

<p><em>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br/>
And sorry I could not travel both<br/>
And be one traveler, long I stood<br/>
And looked down one as far as I could<br/>
To where it bent in the undergrowth.</em></p>

<p><em>Then took the other, as just as fair,<br/>
And having perhaps the better claim,<br/>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br/>
Though as for that the passing there<br/>
Had worn them really about the same.</em></p>

<p><em>And both that morning equally lay<br/>
In leaves no step had trodden black.<br/>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br/>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br/>
I doubted if I should ever come back.</em></p>

<p><em>I shall be telling this with a sigh*<br/>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br/>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I&ndash;<br/>
I took the one less traveled by,<br/>
And that has made all the difference.</em></p>

<p>* According to the Wikipedias, when asked, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he responded &ldquo;[The sigh] was my rather <strong>private jest at the expense of those who might think I would yet live to be sorry for the way I had taken in life</strong>.&rdquo; What is curious to me, a non-poet, is why it took Mr. Frost four paragraphs to say what he later said in a sentence.</p>
