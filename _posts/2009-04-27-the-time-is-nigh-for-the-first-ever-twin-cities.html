<p>It’s going down THIS Friday, May 1st, from 5 to 7PM at the <a href="https://www.bedlamtheatre.org/">Bedlam Theater</a>.</p>

<p>The folks at the Bedlam have been ridiculously awesome to work with and it looks like the place will be hoppin’ with all kinds of music and activity. I gotta say, I’m pretty excited for this.</p>

<p>Quick thanks to Paul Merril (<a href="https://stuffaboutminneapolis.tumblr.com/">Stuff about Minneapolis</a> on Tumblr) for the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/12279886@N06/3430713390/">original postcard</a> used in the flier above.</p></blockquote>

<p>See you there!</p>
