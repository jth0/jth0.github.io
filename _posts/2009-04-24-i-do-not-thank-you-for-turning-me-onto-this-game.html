<p>I had a very similar situation two weeks ago. A coworker handed me his iPhone and walked away. I looked at it as two planes crashed in mid-air, then I tried again. A half-hour later, my coworker had to physically remove his iPhone from my hands. So I took my iPhone out of my pocket, bought Flight Control and played for another half-hour.</p>

<p>I think I remember why I don&rsquo;t play games.</p>
