        <br/><p>So I went and sat down about a year ago with <a href="https://garrickvanburen.com/">Garrick Van Buren</a> to chat on his podcast, <a href="https://www.firstcrackpodcast.com/archive/first-crack-122-john-hoffoss-on-usability-and-network-security/">First Crack</a>, about information security, usability, and how they should work in concert, yet so rarely do. I hope you enjoy.</p>
