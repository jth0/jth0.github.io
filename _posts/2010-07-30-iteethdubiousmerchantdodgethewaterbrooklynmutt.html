<p><strong>Rep. Weiner GOES OFF On Republicans Over Blocking 9/11 Health Compensation Act -Â </strong><a href="https://www.thepoliticalcarnival.net/2010/07/video-rep-weiner-goes-off-on-republicans-over-911-health-compensation-act-whoa/">TPC</a></p>
<p><em>I love this guy</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rep. Anthony Weiner spoke on the House floor tonight in support of H.R. 847, the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, which was blocked from passage by House Republicans. Rep. Weiner addresses some of the false arguments Republicans were using in their opposition to the bill. The vote was 255 to 159 in support of the bill, short of the 2/3 needed for passage; 155 Republicans voted against the legislation, which provides medical monitoring and treatment to World Trade Center responders and survivors who were exposed to the toxins at Ground Zero.</p>

<p>This makes me sick. &ldquo;Oh, 9/11, how tragic! Unite! Get the terrorists! Go to war! (Democrats, don&rsquo;t you know it&rsquo;s un-American to protest while we&rsquo;re at war!?) Oh, what? The first responders and survivors want healthcare? That&rsquo;s SOCIALIST! How dare those <em>firefighters and EMTs and survivors</em> have the gall to ask for <em>handouts</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What the fuck is wrong with this country&rsquo;s politicians? At least some jackass had the balls to stand up and start pointing out to everyone the elephant in the room. We need less of all of this, and more of what Rep. Weiner&rsquo;s talking about. You believe? You vote yes. You don&rsquo;t? You vote no.</p>
