<p>Did you have this poster on your wall as a child?</p>
<p>Did you get it for free at the theatre the night you went see the original <i>Star Wars</i> in 1977?</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>Bah. Your argument. She be invalid.</p>

<p>No, I wasn&rsquo;t born yet.</p>

<p>But I am still a fan, and want to celebrate today, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Day">Star Wars Day</a></strong>!</p>

<p>May the 4th be with you!</p>
