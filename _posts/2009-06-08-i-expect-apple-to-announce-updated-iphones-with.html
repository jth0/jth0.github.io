  current lineup: $199/299 [with a 2 year contract, assuming you’re upgrade-eligible]
  for 16/32 GB, respectively. The video camera is going to be a major selling point.'

<p>Unless you&rsquo;re using a non-3G, you can probably plan on either $400/$500 if you&rsquo;re not eligible for upgrade, plus a contract extension, or $600/$700 with no contract requirement.</p>
