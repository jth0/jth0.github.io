<p>So, I&rsquo;ve got a young gentleman from France <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org/about.html">CouchSurfing</a> with me. He told me he&rsquo;d make us creeps. I didn&rsquo;t think you could do that to another person. Then I realized he was saying crêpes. Which I tend to pronounce as creyps. Benjamin making us crêpes rather than creeps, to me, was a very good thing. Best of all, there were leftovers, to which I added bacon (of course), scrambled eggs, and chèvre (goat cheese). I would have posted a picture, but I&rsquo;ve gone and eaten it all.</p>
