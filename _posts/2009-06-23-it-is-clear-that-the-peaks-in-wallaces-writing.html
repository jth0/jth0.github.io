title: It is clear that the peaks in Wallace’s writing are an order of magnitude greater
  than the occasional valleys. And based on the first 20 pages of Infinite Jest, [it]
  looks as though the peaks in this novel will be so plentiful that altitude sickness
  will pose the biggest threat. Like a climber headed toward his first summit, I am
  filled with an excitement tinged with apprehension, and a hope that I have enough
  oxygen for the journey.

<p>This is gonna be so rad&ndash;<a href="https://infinitesummer.org/archives/320/comment-page-1#comment-544">I mean hard</a>. Rad too, though. I&rsquo;ve already had to look up about fifteen words. I am <em>not</em> used to reading this way.</p>
