<blockquote>Polar Bear Sighting: Powderhorn Park May Day Parade</blockquote>



<p>This was my favorite thing about the May Day Parade last weekend. It blinked and opened it’s mouth. So cool.</p>

<p>Funny story: We ran into <a href="https://daily.theopie.com/">James Lindsay</a> (who I had just met a few nights before at the Tumblr Meetup) and his girlfriend at the parade at just about the same time the bears started coming through. When Shanai and I started freaking out at first sight of this incredible polar bear I heard him lean over and whisper to her softly, “They have this blog. About polar bears.”</p>

<p>I couldn’t see her because they were standing behind us, but I imagined her nodding knowingly.</p></blockquote>

<p>I was on the other side of Bloomington, so I got a nice view of the black bear. They&rsquo;ve also got an articulated tongue. Most importantly, the puppeteers maneuvering these gentle beasts are masters. The bears meander and lope with such natural movement that from four blocks away, you would most certainly mistake these for real bears.</p>
