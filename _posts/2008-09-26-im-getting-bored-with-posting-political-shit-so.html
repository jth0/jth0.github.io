<blockquote>Nathan Gentry, age 6, sits by a window overlooking New York City traffic on September 8, 2006. Nathan&rsquo;s mother: &ldquo;We were in NYC consulting with the doctors there after Nathan&rsquo;s second relapse. He had much treatment in NYC in previous years and LOVED the city. He died about 10 months after this picture was taken. Part of the reason I treasure this photo is I can see his feet. I spent hours rubbing those feet while he had a very painful treatments.&rdquo; (Â© Susan Gentry, who asked for a link to the <a href="https://www.nbhope.org/">Children&rsquo;s Neuroblastoma Cancer Foundation</a>)</blockquote>
