You see, <a href="https://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2009/02/breaking-beer-no-longer-recession-proof.html">beer is no longer recession-proof</a>. Thousands of microbreweries, brewpubs, and craft breweries need you step up to this challenge, to support America. Do your part and quit drinking Budweicoormillichelob, and replace it with a craft beer made locally, whether that means your <a href="https://www.surlybrewing.com">city</a>, your <a href="https://www.schellsbrewery.com">state</a>, or even your <a href="https://www.tyranena.com">region</a>. And pretty much everyone has access to at least <a href="https://www.samueladams.com">one national craft brewer</a>. Not only will you help support someone who brews for the love of their beer, but you&rsquo;ll support your tastebuds and your tummy, who after years of watered-down, corn-based beer, have been hungering for flavor.</p>

<p>My thanks to Nate Silver and FiveThirtyEight for taking up this worthy cause.</p>
