<blockquote><p><strong>This is my Flipboard.</strong></p>
<p>That’s what I’m calling this little video I made to demonstrate the elegance and ingenuity of a new iPad app called <a href="https://www.flipboard.com/">Flipboard</a>. I think you’ll agree, it <em>looks</em> nice. I also think you’ll find, once you download the app, that it <em>feels</em> amazing.</p>
<p>Here’s the effect it’s had on me in my couple of months using it in beta: I tend not to follow too many people on Twitter for the content they share, and in a typical Twitter client, I tend to gloss over links and images. Flipboard gives me such a nice way to read this stuff, I use it as an auxiliary client, just for the linked content. Turns out there’s some interesting stuff hidden behind all those ugly short URLs and yfrogs.</p>
<p>Big thanks to the talented and illustrious <a href="https://atencio.tumblr.com/">Peter Atencio</a> for his work behind the lens, and to my handsome and kindhearted nephew Wes who knows how to swing.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yet another reason I want an iPad.</p>
