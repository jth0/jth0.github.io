<blockquote><p>Airplanes flying into MSP International Airport have been rerouted to fly directly over our house. They come every 90 seconds (we timed them).</p>

<p>Every time they pass we have to stop talking to let the roar of the engines overhead subside. Itâ€™s driving us all a little crazy.</p>

<p>This is the view from my bed.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been getting lots more noise as well. Even worse, as I&rsquo;m very close to the airport, but normally in a quiet pocket with almost no plane noise. You can go here to file a noise complaint, which I&rsquo;d recommend doing. I&rsquo;m not sure why flights have been rerouted, but I&rsquo;m not happy about it, nor am I in a MAC improvements bubble which would at least get my windows updated. Thing is, I&rsquo;d rather have less noise than new windows, since my wife and I spend so much time on our screened porch and our yard.</p>
