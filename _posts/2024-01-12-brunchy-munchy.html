<p>I had brunch yesterday with a colleague and really enjoyed our conversation. He mentioned a book series that his son was reading, and really enjoyed. I bought and started reading that book with my daughter last night and she enjoyed it. She’s now excited to pick it up to find out what happens next. It’s been a challenge to find books that she engages with, so I’m very excited to see if she picks up the series too.</p>
