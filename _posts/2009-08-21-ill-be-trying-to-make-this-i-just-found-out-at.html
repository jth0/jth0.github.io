<img src="/assets/post_files/tumblr_kop0m7tqjt1qze4i7o1_400.jpg"/><br/><p>I&rsquo;ll be trying to make this. I just found out at the ol&rsquo; ten year reunion that one of my classmates was one of the many people involved in this exhibition. The actual exhibit is at <a href="https://www.formandcontent.org/fc.current.htm">Form + Content</a> (210 2nd St. N., Minneapolis, MN 55401) until September the fifth.</p>

<p><a href="https://westbanksocialcenter.org/post/167583303/presentations-and-discussions-on-creatively">wbsc</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Presentations and discussions on creatively unbundling the housing crisis.</b></p>
<p>In recent years, the housing crisis has transformed once vibrant neighborhoods into vacant landscapes of foreclosure and collapse. Much attention has been given to the financial causes of the crisis but few projects have gone beyond that, until now.</p>
<p>In the exhibit “Unbundling the Housing Crisis,” at the <a href="https://www.formandcontent.org/fc.current.htm">Form + Content Gallery</a> now through September 5th, 8 interdisciplinary groups of artists, designers, writers, scientists, and thinkers were asked to collaborate, research, create and present projects examining all aspects of the housing crisis.</p>
<p>At 7pm on September 10th at the <a href="https://westbanksocialcenter.org/">West Bank Social Center</a>, these 8 groups come together to present their projects, discuss their process, and share their creative approaches to understanding and unbundling the housing crisis.</p>
