<blockquote><p>I’m swooning this morning over The Current, a public radio station in Minneapolis that also streams online.  I discovered them a couple of days ago when Robyn Hitchcock was an in-studio guest and cued ‘em up again this a.m. when he appeared on a taped segment spinning some of his all-time fave tracks.</p>
<p>Since then they’ve won my barnacled heart with a playlist that sandwiched Kool &amp; the Gang between the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Empire of the Sun and—as I type this—they just served a Joe Jackson apertif to complement a meaty new(ish) Franz Ferdinand track.</p>
<p>Check ‘em out, yo.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s Minnesota Public Radio (and American Public Media), and they&rsquo;re out of St. Paul, MN, kitty-corner from my office. But yes, they rock.</p>
