<p>People die every day - whether it’s from getting shot just for standing up for the rights, from hunger, etc… and no one really cares. But then a celebrity dies, and all of a sudden it’s a huge deal and people can’t stop talking about it. It basically shows what people care more about.</p>
<p>I should just buy an island and move now.</p>

<p>Unfair. I care about just about everyone that dies, from any cause. Some people have more of an impact on your life than others, so you talk about their death more. It’s just the way it is. It’s not about MJ being a celebrity. It’s about him being someone who’s music I grew up with, who’s songs touched me in different ways, etc. You are more likely to discuss the things that that touch you, the people that affect you. Just like every other topic in the world…</p>

<p>Seriously. The man is a legend. It’s obviously going to affect people more than some random stranger’s death.</p></blockquote>

<p>Actually, not really.</p>
