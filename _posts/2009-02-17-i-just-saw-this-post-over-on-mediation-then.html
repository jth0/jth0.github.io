<img src="/assets/post_files/TxUk6mAtEk2mzyd3KBlAlokro1_1280.png"/><br/><p>I just saw <a href="https://mediation.tumblr.com/post/79128486/a-new-ad-campaign-that-tries-to-get-kids-to-do">this post over on mediation</a>, then clicked through to see the above on <a href="https://adweek.blogs.com/adfreak/2009/02/good-lord-barbie-is-really-letting-herself-go.html">AdFreak</a>. I wonder who&rsquo;d be more upset: <a href="https://www.brandfreak.com/2009/02/the-vassarettes-dont-any-encouragement-to-take-off-their-tops.html">the girl band that has to play in a bra to get an audience</a>, featured over on AdFreak&rsquo;s sister site BandFreak, or <a href="https://activelifemovement.org/">Active Life Movement, the folks behind the fat toys campaign</a>.</p>
