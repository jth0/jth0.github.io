<p>- Tim De Chent, If the world’s population lived in one city… via <a href="https://persquaremile.com/2011/01/18/if-the-worlds-population-lived-in-one-city/">Per Square Mile</a></p>
<p>So, if we can move past the haphazard historical, cultural, and biological reasons that people live where they currently are, we could pick a few hundred places in the world where there are good reasons to live, and move all the people to those places. Places with reliable water, equitable climates, available farmland. And then we can rewild the rest of the world.</p>
