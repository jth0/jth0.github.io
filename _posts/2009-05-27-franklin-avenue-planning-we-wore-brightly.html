<blockquote>
  <p>We wore brightly colored vests and carried bright yellow flags to alert drivers of pedestrians who needed to cross the street. We also handed out fliers that summarized right of way laws. <strong>Even if there isnâ€™t a marked crosswalk</strong>, a pedestrian has a right to cross as long as approaching cars are far enough away to easily stop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>An unmarked cross-walk means an intersection, not the middle of a block.</strong> <a href="https://www.minnesotasafetycouncil.org/facts/factsheet.cfm?qs=BD3BE1A6DFA3335E">Deets</a>.</p>
