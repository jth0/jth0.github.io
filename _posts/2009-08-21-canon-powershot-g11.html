<blockquote><p><b>Canon PowerShot G11</b></p>
<p>A few weeks ago I picked up the <a target="_self" href="https://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;fcategoryid=144&amp;modelid=17624">Canon G10</a>. I’ve been satisfied with the picture quality but it’s not nearly the quality of an SLR but I’ll take the portability factor FTW. Canon today showcased the sucessor to the G10, the G11.</p>
<p>Specs are as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>10MP instead of 14MP (G10)</li>
<li>2.8-inch vari-angle LCD</li>
<li>5x optical zoom</li>
<li>RAW support (G10 already supports) [<em>As did the G9</em>]</li>
</ul>
<p>The aesthetics of the camera seem to have changed (slimmer) but why keep the video quality the same? The pixel quality went down from 14 to 10 and all you got a vari-angle LCD. I don’t think this camera deserves the G11 title.</p>
<p>$499.99 when it lands in October</p>

<p>The thing is there&rsquo;s little to no difference between 10MP and 14MP. The difference, which has been a long time coming in a consumer point &amp; shoot, is low-light and high-ISO performance, which this camera has. While the resolution may be &ldquo;only&rdquo; 10MP, the quality of shots you&rsquo;ll get in low-light situations will drastically improve, in part, because each pixel is actually larger, allowing you to capture *more* detail than you would otherwise. The G11 should prove a drastic improvement.</p>
