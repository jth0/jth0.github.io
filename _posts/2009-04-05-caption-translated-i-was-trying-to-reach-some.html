Man, it really hurt to poop all these white rocks out. But drinking all the rum that my mum left in this bucket helped me feel better. Now I don&rsquo;t feel so good. I&rsquo;m glad I have this empty bucket to get sick into. Oh, and look! Mum let me where my bee costume to the party!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is what happens when I browse the internet too late. Bad captions applied to horrible photography.</p>
