<blockquote>A Muslim pilgrim prays at the top of Mount Noor in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, Friday, Dec. 5. The pilgrims will visit the Hera cave in Mount Noor where the Prophet Mohammad worshipped before the revelation. Mecca at that time was a society governed by ignorance and corruption and in order for the Prophet to worship in privacy, he went alone to Hera cave outside the city. His solitude was spent in prayer and reflection. <strong>AP/Hassan Ammar</strong></blockquote>
