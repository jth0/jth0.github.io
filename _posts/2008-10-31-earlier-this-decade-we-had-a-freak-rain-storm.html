title: "…earlier this decade we had a freak rain storm that produced a lot of hail
  in [Southern California]. The quantity and ferocity allowed for the frozen precipitation
  to collect on the ground and if you looked at it from the SkyChopper 5 Live-Feed,
  it looked like snow. This was enough for the inner-city youth to lie on the ground
  in front a local 7-11 to make what the reporter lady called “snow angels”. I called
  it “sadness”."
