It&rsquo;ll sit in the kitchen, and has a hidden power strip for our cell phone chargers and lighting. Top down:</p><ul><li>A chalk board door hiding two shelves for books</li><li>The cubby for cell phones, keys, etc. </li><li>Two side-by-side drawers for recipe cards (4x6&hellip;none of that 3x5 crap for us!), </li><li>Then three drawers for spices</li><li>and last, a drawer holding our trash can.</li></ul><p>Might have to put a box of baking soda in there to control odors though&hellip; </p>
