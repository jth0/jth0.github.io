<p>PEREZ HILTON GOT BEAT UP BY FUCKING WILL.I.AM.</p>
<p><i>I. KNOW. RIGHT? </i></p>
<p>HOLY FUCKING SHIT THAT IS THE FUNNIEST THING IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. sorry, but that dude is a midget. can you imagine a midget beating you up? and isnâ€™t the dude a hologram or something?</p>

<p>She (oh wait, Perez is a dude?) should&rsquo;ve asked the Twitters for the number for 911, perhaps. Last I checked, 911 operators don&rsquo;t monitor Twitter for calls for help. And imagine if someone tried to call 911:</p>

<ul>
<li>911: 911, what&rsquo;s your emergency?</li>
<li>Caller: Perez Hilton said she was beat up by a rapper on Twitter.</li>
<li>911: What? Is Twitter that thing I saw on Oprah? How does that work?</li>
<li>Caller: Yeah, it&rsquo;s pretty cool. You know the status thing in FaceBook? It&rsquo;s like&ndash;</li>
<li>911: Nevermind about that. So who did you say was beat up?</li>
<li>Caller: Perez Hilton.</li>
<li>911: You mean the girl from that TV show with Lionel Ritchie&rsquo;s daughter?</li>
<li>Caller: No, that&rsquo;s PAIR-is. This is per-EZZ. P-e-r-e-z.</li>
<li>911: Is she related to Paris?</li>
<li>Caller: It&rsquo;s a he. And I don&rsquo;t think so. He&rsquo;s at the SoHo Met.</li>
<li>911: He&rsquo;s at the what? And who names a boy Perez?</li>
<li>Caller: I&rsquo;m not sure who his parents are. He&rsquo;s at the Met in SoHo. He was beat up by Will.I.Am.</li>
<li>911: You&rsquo;re what? And do you know Will&rsquo;s last name?</li>
<li>Caller: No, the rapper&rsquo;s name is &ldquo;William&rdquo;, but spelled &ldquo;Will-dot-I-dot-Am&rdquo;.</li>
<li>911: Who puts dots in their son&rsquo;s name like that?</li>
<li>Caller: No idea. I think SoHo is in New York, but there&rsquo;s one in Tampa, London, Hong Kong, Philadelphia, no I mean Pittsburgh. Oh wait, says here he&rsquo;s at the MuchMusic awards.</li>
<li>911: The what!?</li>
<li>Caller: Oh, I guess that&rsquo;s in Toronto.</li>
<li>911: Sir, why are you calling 911 in Lake Havasu, AZ for help in Toronto?</li>
<li>Caller: Because Perez said he needed help on Twitter!</li>
<li>911: Okay, so explain this Twitter thing again?</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh, and <a href="https://twitter.com/PerezHilton/status/2276453615">evidently a few people <em>did</em> call</a>.</p>
