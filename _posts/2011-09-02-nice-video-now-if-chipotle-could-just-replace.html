<p>Nice video. Now if Chipotle could just replace their Minnesota with legal Mexicans, because no matter how ethical the production, if the product lacks luster, they will lose market. Chipotle&rsquo;s burritos&ndash;and the quality of cooking into each ingredient&ndash;and the service&ndash;were consistently better here before the immigration &amp; customs raids, despite the chain having been heavily staffed by illegal immigrants.</p>
