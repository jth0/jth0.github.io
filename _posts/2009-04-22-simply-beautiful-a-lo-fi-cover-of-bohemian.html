A lo-fi cover of Bohemian Rhapsody.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is dedicated to all fans of Queen and hey let&rsquo;s not forget about Mike Myers and Dana Carvey of Wayne&rsquo;s World. No effects or sampling was used. What you see is what you hear (does that even make sense?)</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Atari 800XL was used for the lead piano/organ sound</li>
  <li>Texas Instruments TI-99/4a as lead guitar</li>
  <li>8 Inch Floppy Disk as Bass</li>
  <li>3.5 inch Harddrive as the gong</li>
  <li>HP ScanJet 3C was used for all vocals.**</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>** Please note I had to record the HP scanner 4 seperate times for each voice. I tried to buy 4 HP scanners but for some reason sellers on E-Bay expect you to pay $80-$100, I got mine for $30.</p>
  
  <p>I keep hearing parts of the song are out of tune. Keep in mind the scanner and floppy drive are not musical instruments. These are mechanical devices whose motors tend to drift and can cause some notes to be out of tune.</p>
