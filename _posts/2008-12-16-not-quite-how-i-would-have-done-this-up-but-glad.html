<p>Please note that in my own personal opinion, laughing about this incident is about the only thing that can be done. It shows both the lack of respect America has today abroad, especially in Iraq, and a lack of comprehension of what America has accomplished in Iraq. For example, this journalist is still alive. But I&rsquo;m extremely saddened by the fact that Iraqi authorities <em>may</em> have <a href="https://minnesotaindependent.com/20326/is-the-iraqi-shoe-thrower-being-tortured">resorted</a> to a <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7785338.stm">similar response</a> that Hussein&rsquo;s regime might have meted out. I also find it idiotic that anyone would push for freeing <a href="https://www.thenational.ae/article/20081216/FOREIGN/229561622/1001">al Zaidi</a>. Freedom doesn&rsquo;t mean free from the consequences of your actions, and high on that list would be throwing anything at a national figurehead.</p>

<p>[Edit: Now <a href="https://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/12/bush-shoe-toss.html">these</a> are more like what I had in mind!}</p>
