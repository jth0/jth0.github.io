<img src="/assets/post_files/TxUk6mAtEn8xj9b2cSj1JWomo1_540.png"/><br/><p>I spent last evening at MinneDemo, a wonderful (though crowded &amp; warm) event where a few folks presented functioning demos of their software or website. The one presentation I was actually able to see was Extendr, and pictured above is my profile. Click through to check it out, and make sure you catch the <strong>Tour</strong>, the most interesting piece of Extendr&rsquo;s offering.</p>

<p>I have yet to decide if I prefer this over <a href="https://www.google.com/profiles/john.t.hoffoss">Google Profiles</a>.</p>

<p>If you sign up, find me and add me as a contact using the tag Tumblr. What do you think? Which do you prefer?</p>
