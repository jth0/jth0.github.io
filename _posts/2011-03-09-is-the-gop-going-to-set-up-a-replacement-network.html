<p> Not content with depriving women of reproductive healthcare, House Republicans want to starve them and their children too. Their budget cuts the Women, Infants and Children Health and Nutrition program by $750 million and Head Start by $1 billion. It cuts $50 million from a block grant that pays for prenatal healthcare for 2.5 million low-income women and healthcare for 31 million children each year. As Charles Blow writes in the <em>New York Times</em>, proposed cuts to medical research strike directly at efforts to roll back the US infant mortality rate, now the highest among advanced economies. The Republicans seem bent on proving the truth of the bitter joke that “prolifers” care about children only before they are born. As for caring about women? Even as fetal vessels, the ladies just don’t count. After all, one in five women has visited a Planned Parenthood clinic—often for routine gynecological care.</p>

<p>Yes, essentially. And it&rsquo;s much more than one in five women, and it&rsquo;s much more than often. By far, the majority of Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s activities are educating women about sex and their bodies (thank you, abstinence-only sex ed&hellip;) and, as mentioned, routine gynecological care.</p>
