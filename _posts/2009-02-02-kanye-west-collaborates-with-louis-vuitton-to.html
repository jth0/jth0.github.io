<img src="/assets/post_files/TxUk6mAtEjgtceopEe3BY1Rio1_640.jpg"/><br/><p><a href="https://www.wyendrys.com/archives/436">Kanye West collaborates with Louis Vuitton</a> to create what may be one of the ugliest sneaker designs of all time. Congrats, Kanye. Louis, WTF?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen these come up on other artsy blogs, but lacking the commentary, which indicates to me that those bloggers might like this design, the prospect of which frightens me.</p>
