title: In our current political climate, which is dominated by the loud voice of the
  tea party, anyone who calls attention to the electorate’s woeful lack of knowledge
  can expect to be labeled “elitist” or “out of touch.” But what these populists forget
  is that many of the Founding Fathers — the same Founding Fathers whom tea party
  supporters appeal to on a regular basis for their views on government, religion
  and the Constitution — were the most “elitist” politicians in American history.
