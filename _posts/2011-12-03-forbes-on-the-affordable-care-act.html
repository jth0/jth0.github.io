<blockquote>
  <p>If you believe that the end of private, for-profit health insurance is some type of nefarious step towards a socialist society, then you might want to attend church this Sunday to mourn the loss of health insurers being able to worm out of covering the bills of a cancer patient because she forgot to write down on her application that she had skin acne for three months when she was a teenager.</p>
  
  <p>Of course, those of you who fear the inevitable arrival of universal health care really shouldnâ€™t be too fretful. There will always be a for-profit health insurance industry for those who want to pay for it. The only difference will be that those who cannot afford private coverage will also have an opportunity to get their families the medical care that they need</p>
  
  <p>Everyone wins-except the for-profit health insurers.</p>
