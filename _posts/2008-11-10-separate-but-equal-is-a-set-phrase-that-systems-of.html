<blockquote>Separate but equal is a set phrase that systems of segregation giving different &ldquo;colored only&rdquo; facilities or services with the declaration that the quality of each group&rsquo;s public facilities remain equal.</blockquote>&#8212;Thanks for that definition, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separate_but_equal">Wikipedia</a>. It&rsquo;s <strike>really too bad</strike> <strong>fucking pathetic</strong> that we can&rsquo;t even satisfy this pathetic level of &ldquo;equality&rdquo; for homosexual Americans. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_8_(2008)">Proposition 8</a> should never have passed. Unfortunately, California is only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_the_United_States">one of many</a> states with constitutional amendments defining marriage as a union of one man and one woman.
