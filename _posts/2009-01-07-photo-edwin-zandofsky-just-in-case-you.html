<p>Just in case you haven&rsquo;t already heard, you can pull PDFs of most back-issues of JPG magazine. Even better news is that they have a few interested buyers that may allow JPG to live on, so act quick for those archives if you aren&rsquo;t fortunate enough to have been a subscriber until now!</p>
