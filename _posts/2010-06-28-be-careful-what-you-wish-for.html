<blockquote>
  <p>For months, the man police are accusing of gathering the ingredients to create volatile explosives mused – in person and online – about testing the capabilities of Toronto’s G20 security.</p>
  
  <p>Friends say Byron Sonne talked about obtaining the “chemical precursors” to explosives “in an attempt to purposefully raise flags and get ‘the man’ to take a look at me&hellip; but no luck,” as he wrote on an online forum for HackLab T.O. last fall.</p>
  
  <p>It would seem “the man” looked.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/man-charged-in-g20-probe-gathered-makings-for-volatile-explosives-police-charge/article1614068/">Byron Sonne and his partner, Kristen Peterson</a>, are both accused of planning a terrorist attack in Toronto for the G20 Summit. <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/man-charged-in-g20-probe-gathered-makings-for-volatile-explosives-police-charge/article1614068/">The charges are pretty ridiculous</a>. Sonne has made no secret of his intentions to &ldquo;test&rdquo; the monitoring taking place around G20 security efforts in Toronto. While this is a common mindset for information security pros, testing the security around G20&ndash;a billion dollar affair&ndash;without an engagement to do so professionally for the G20 organizers is a Bad Idea™. For people who spent <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/g8-g20/background/no-mere-barricade/article1614025/">$5M on a fence</a> and <a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/jun/28/g20-security-bill">$57K on a four-inch deep lake in a convention center</a>, they&rsquo;re probably not going to listen too hard at someone saying &ldquo;I was only testing you!&rdquo;</p>
