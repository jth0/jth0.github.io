<p>He eats there maybe four times a week. And the other day, he walks in to pick up his burrito, and the staff said, hey, you’re our best customer, we’re appointing you Burrito Ambassador. Then they gave him a free t-shirt, a stress ball in the shape of a burrito, and they’re sending him a commemorative plaque to hang on the wall. Oh, and they now will deliver his burritos to the office for free.</p>
<p>This is an actual thing that happened.</p>

<p>Burrito shaped stress ball?</p></blockquote>

<p>Further proof that the rich (and burritoey) just get richer (and burritoier).</p>
