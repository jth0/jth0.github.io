<p>Last time I saw these lovely ladies, I was given free beer by their opening band. This band was very odd&ndash;the lead had this sort of fish-gulp thing going on. The free beer was shitty (but free). I got to hold Kim&rsquo;s coffee and help her up on the stage when they went on, though, which was neat. Oh, you know that beer I mentioned? Because I drank it, I wound up missing the last third of the Breeders&rsquo; set because I had to take a leak and couldn&rsquo;t get back to my spot in the <strong>front &amp; center of the stage</strong>. [another] /sob. This was also the night I realized I had a hernia. But then we got to chat with Kim &amp; Kelley after the show since they were just hanging out at the stage.</p>

<p>This was in all seriousness one of my best nights from college.</p>
