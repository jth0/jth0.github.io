@LittleMcGeorge @SRDorman @kristadb1 Also, if you get into it enough, CookWise (Corriher) is a great cookbook that includes a science-y (but highly readable) breakdown of how &amp; why cooking &amp; baking works. Over time, will help diagnose &amp; fix issues with recipes, even before you make them the first time.
