@Kym_Possible @mroytman We were chatting at #siracon2018 about kinds of "barista blend" almond milk. I wound up with Pacific over Califia (this https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U9VM65M/ref=snk_ddb_dp_2_mdpajx?smid=AJAYEY7URLUIN&ie=UTF8&th=1) and really like it. It holds foam *very* well, has a good neutral flavor, and not too sweet.
